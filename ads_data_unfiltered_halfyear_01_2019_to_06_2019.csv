"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures.

"['Solar Electric (PV) is now cheaper than continuing to  pay your electric company and the government even has money to help you pay for it. Come learn the facts. \n\nClearly a day of technical instruction, no matter how good (and trust us, this will be good), will not make you an expert. But you will find that you have a better appreciation for the capabilities of PV, the pros and cons of installing it at this time, the economics, system options, maintenance issues and much more. This seminar (no hands on) is designed for individuals with little or no background in electricity or photovoltaics, but who are interested in solar energy and its applications. The course has been approved for Continuing Education in several fields, see below. \n\nThis course will touch on:\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Power\n‚Ä¢ Basic Principles and Concepts of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ The Economics of Photovoltaics\n‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic System Components\n‚Ä¢ Standard system configurations\n‚Ä¢ Site assessment\n‚Ä¢ Designing a PV system\n‚Ä¢ Battery Systems\n‚Ä¢ System Installation\n‚Ä¢ Permits and Required Agreements\n‚Ä¢ Testing and Commissioning the System\n‚Ä¢ System Maintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nThe class will include basic electrical and photovoltaic principles and concepts; photovoltaic system components, and how to select the items that are right in a given situation; standard PV system configurations, and when and why to use each; how to conduct a site assessment; how to design a photovoltaic system; sizing and selecting a battery system; steps involved in system installation; and rules, regulations and paperwork required. \n\nAn introductory, but technical course on the design and installation of solar electric systems within residential and light commercial structures. Instructor is Jay Warmke of Blue Rock Station. For more information, contact Blue Rock Station at 740-674-4300 or bluerockstation.com or click the ""buy a ticket"" link.\n\nNext Class Offered:\n\nBlue Rock Station will also offer a 35-hour Residential Solar Installer Level 1 training, leading to certification, at FUUSM March 18-22. Cost for that class is $970 before March 4, or $1,070 after. Cost includes course materials, ETA examination, and lunch. Two scholarships that will cover approximately one-third of this fee will be available. Class size is limited to 10 students.

"['Banana Bob Ballinger\n\nThe last time I wrote about Bob Ballinger, he was a state representative. Due to term limits, he jumped ship. Unfortunately for us, his ship wasn\'t at sea at the time. Instead, he found a spot in the state senate.\n\nBallinger is proof that our legislature is not necessarily where the best go to serve. I ponder the fact that this man is an attorney in his private life. He\'s intelligent and earns a great living as a private attorney. As a state senator, he earns a base salary of over $40,000, which doesn\'t include per diems and the other myriad ways he is compensated for his public service. ""It\'s a pittance for the amount of work I do,"" he\'ll say, all the while punishing the lower income workers in the state, most of whom know the value of hard, physical work.\n\nHe\'ll claim it is to protect the state, of course. Nothing protects those in the state like hurting them the most. It\'s this type of logic which makes me loathe many of the participants in the political process. There are better ways and better people to make these decisions. It\'s possible to balance the interests of citizens against those of commerce without sacrificing anyone in the process or resorting to polarizing policies.\n\nWhen I read his quotes dismissing the will of the voters regarding the minimum wage, my first reaction was to be astonished at his mental gymnastics. It occurred to me that both gymnastics and mental acuity are both foreign to Bob. To be clear, I\'m not ridiculing his physical appearance; belaboring such a point is for someone else. The more I read his opinion on the issue of the minimum wage, the stupider I felt. I\'m certain my IQ is now permanently diminished after ingesting the alleged logic of his support to subvert the will of the people in regards to the minimum wage. Since he\'s an attorney, I find it doubtful that Bob truthfully believes the reasoning he\'s providing publicly for his proposed bill. In his defense, I concede that I could be totally wrong. \n\nCan the state circumvent the will of the people? Of course. Can we outlaw bad haircuts and make elected officials like Bob upset? Of course, we can. We shouldn\'t have to remind an elected official to not second guess our vote, especially one which literally just happened.\n\nLet\'s be clear. People like Bob in actuality would enjoy reducing the minimum wage to zero. Whether we want to be reminded of it, people like Ballinger are exactly what is wrong with the Arkansas political system. They polarize through demagoguery and a stubbornly thin grasp of the issues they are supposed to be working to improve.\n\nWe have so many more well-qualified people who demonstrably have a better grasp of government, economics, and the realities of being a human struggling to work and live responsibly. It\'s immaterial to me that Ballinger is a Republican. The crux of my distaste for him lies in how he conducts himself as an elected employee for this state and the tunnel vision which allows him to ignore any evidence contradicting his chosen worldview. Again, maybe I\'m as stupid as I sometimes sound. I\'ll at least entertain the possibility, an attribute which would well serve our elected officials as they conduct our business, openly and as our employees. \n\nIf I\'m hit in the head with a falling brick anytime soon, I\'ll move to his district and run against him in the next election. He\'s smarter than I am, but being smart is mostly irrelevant regarding the election of many of our elected employees. There\'s no doubt he\'ll be there, eager to pontificate and cash his government paycheck. To defeat him in the next election, all I\'ll need to do is to learn ventriloquism and start talking out of my derriere. Voters will be confused by the fact that there will be two of us doing so.\n\nThanks for nothing, Bob.\n\nThe people have spoken.\n\nHow about you listen for once?\n.']",['en'],2019-01-18,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",363317694495714,1999.0

"['Banana Bob Ballinger\n\nThe last time I wrote about Bob Ballinger, he was a state representative. Due to term limits, he jumped ship. Unfortunately for us, his ship wasn\'t at sea at the time. Instead, he found a spot in the state senate.\n\nBallinger is proof that our legislature is not necessarily where the best go to serve. I ponder the fact that this man is an attorney in his private life. He\'s intelligent and earns a great living as a private attorney. As a state senator, he earns a base salary of over $40,000, which doesn\'t include per diems and the other myriad ways he is compensated for his public service. ""It\'s a pittance for the amount of work I do,"" he\'ll say, all the while punishing the lower income workers in the state, most of whom know the value of hard, physical work.\n\nHe\'ll claim it is to protect the state, of course. Nothing protects those in the state like hurting them the most. It\'s this type of logic which makes me loathe many of the participants in the political process. There are better ways and better people to make these decisions. It\'s possible to balance the interests of citizens against those of commerce without sacrificing anyone in the process or resorting to polarizing policies.\n\nWhen I read his quotes dismissing the will of the voters regarding the minimum wage, my first reaction was to be astonished at his mental gymnastics. It occurred to me that both gymnastics and mental acuity are both foreign to Bob. To be clear, I\'m not ridiculing his physical appearance; belaboring such a point is for someone else. The more I read his opinion on the issue of the minimum wage, the stupider I felt. I\'m certain my IQ is now permanently diminished after ingesting the alleged logic of his support to subvert the will of the people in regards to the minimum wage. Since he\'s an attorney, I find it doubtful that Bob truthfully believes the reasoning he\'s providing publicly for his proposed bill. In his defense, I concede that I could be totally wrong. \n\nCan the state circumvent the will of the people? Of course. Can we outlaw bad haircuts and make elected officials like Bob upset? Of course, we can. We shouldn\'t have to remind an elected official to not second guess our vote, especially one which literally just happened.\n\nLet\'s be clear. People like Bob in actuality would enjoy reducing the minimum wage to zero. Whether we want to be reminded of it, people like Ballinger are exactly what is wrong with the Arkansas political system. They polarize through demagoguery and a stubbornly thin grasp of the issues they are supposed to be working to improve.\n\nWe have so many more well-qualified people who demonstrably have a better grasp of government, economics, and the realities of being a human struggling to work and live responsibly. It\'s immaterial to me that Ballinger is a Republican. The crux of my distaste for him lies in how he conducts himself as an elected employee for this state and the tunnel vision which allows him to ignore any evidence contradicting his chosen worldview. Again, maybe I\'m as stupid as I sometimes sound. I\'ll at least entertain the possibility, an attribute which would well serve our elected officials as they conduct our business, openly and as our employees. \n\nIf I\'m hit in the head with a falling brick anytime soon, I\'ll move to his district and run against him in the next election. He\'s smarter than I am, but being smart is mostly irrelevant regarding the election of many of our elected employees. There\'s no doubt he\'ll be there, eager to pontificate and cash his government paycheck. To defeat him in the next election, all I\'ll need to do is to learn ventriloquism and start talking out of my derriere. Voters will be confused by the fact that there will be two of us doing so.\n\nThanks for nothing, Bob.\n\nThe people have spoken.\n\nHow about you listen for once?\n.']",['en'],2019-01-18,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",363317694495714,1999.0

"['Banana Bob Ballinger\n\nThe last time I wrote about Bob Ballinger, he was a state representative. Due to term limits, he jumped ship. Unfortunately for us, his ship wasn\'t at sea at the time. Instead, he found a spot in the state senate.\n\nBallinger is proof that our legislature is not necessarily where the best go to serve. I ponder the fact that this man is an attorney in his private life. He\'s intelligent and earns a great living as a private attorney. As a state senator, he earns a base salary of over $40,000, which doesn\'t include per diems and the other myriad ways he is compensated for his public service. ""It\'s a pittance for the amount of work I do,"" he\'ll say, all the while punishing the lower income workers in the state, most of whom know the value of hard, physical work.\n\nHe\'ll claim it is to protect the state, of course. Nothing protects those in the state like hurting them the most. It\'s this type of logic which makes me loathe many of the participants in the political process. There are better ways and better people to make these decisions. It\'s possible to balance the interests of citizens against those of commerce without sacrificing anyone in the process or resorting to polarizing policies.\n\nWhen I read his quotes dismissing the will of the voters regarding the minimum wage, my first reaction was to be astonished at his mental gymnastics. It occurred to me that both gymnastics and mental acuity are both foreign to Bob. To be clear, I\'m not ridiculing his physical appearance; belaboring such a point is for someone else. The more I read his opinion on the issue of the minimum wage, the stupider I felt. I\'m certain my IQ is now permanently diminished after ingesting the alleged logic of his support to subvert the will of the people in regards to the minimum wage. Since he\'s an attorney, I find it doubtful that Bob truthfully believes the reasoning he\'s providing publicly for his proposed bill. In his defense, I concede that I could be totally wrong. \n\nCan the state circumvent the will of the people? Of course. Can we outlaw bad haircuts and make elected officials like Bob upset? Of course, we can. We shouldn\'t have to remind an elected official to not second guess our vote, especially one which literally just happened.\n\nLet\'s be clear. People like Bob in actuality would enjoy reducing the minimum wage to zero. Whether we want to be reminded of it, people like Ballinger are exactly what is wrong with the Arkansas political system. They polarize through demagoguery and a stubbornly thin grasp of the issues they are supposed to be working to improve.\n\nWe have so many more well-qualified people who demonstrably have a better grasp of government, economics, and the realities of being a human struggling to work and live responsibly. It\'s immaterial to me that Ballinger is a Republican. The crux of my distaste for him lies in how he conducts himself as an elected employee for this state and the tunnel vision which allows him to ignore any evidence contradicting his chosen worldview. Again, maybe I\'m as stupid as I sometimes sound. I\'ll at least entertain the possibility, an attribute which would well serve our elected officials as they conduct our business, openly and as our employees. \n\nIf I\'m hit in the head with a falling brick anytime soon, I\'ll move to his district and run against him in the next election. He\'s smarter than I am, but being smart is mostly irrelevant regarding the election of many of our elected employees. There\'s no doubt he\'ll be there, eager to pontificate and cash his government paycheck. To defeat him in the next election, all I\'ll need to do is to learn ventriloquism and start talking out of my derriere. Voters will be confused by the fact that there will be two of us doing so.\n\nThanks for nothing, Bob.\n\nThe people have spoken.\n\nHow about you listen for once?\n.']",['en'],2019-01-18,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",363317694495714,1999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole.

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['Here is my ""What I really want to say statement"".\n\nDear ""Trumpsters"", How\'s that shutdown for the wall working out for ya? For 2 years I have been sitting here trying to explain to you that the Trump you think exists, the one that he sold you, is a lie. Its a figment of your imagination. Trump sold you on a persona. All you had to do was pay attention, and do a minimal amount of research on the subject, and you would have found that Trump is a total BS artist. He is a liar. A businessman that files bankruptcy 5 times does not a success make. He never cared about you. Here is the blunt truth. Trump never wanted to win the election!! He did it for publicity. The entire idea of the ""build the wall"" argument was a talking point that was engineered for him by Steve Bannon to keep him on track when he talked at campaign rally\'s because he is all over the place. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. For his entire campaign he talked about the rigged election, so that way when he lost, he could say to his supporters that he lost because millions illegally voted, and would be able to explain away said loss, and continue on with his business, having made more money after the campaign! This is the simple reason why he was negotiating the Russia deal until the election- because he intended to build the tower!! Its not complicated! \n\nFor 18 months, I have been trying to explain to all of you why I felt the way I do about Trump, some have been kind, others have not. I have written article after article using all kinds of statistics and research. I have been called fake news, and had homophobic slurs hurled at me, when in the same amount of time it took somebody to write those posts to me, they could have done their own research, and looked up those facts and figures themselves, and actually learned something!! Just because your news agency decides to NOT report something, does not make the information you read on my site ""fake news"". It just means your news outlet has decided to not report something!!! Instead of questioning my words, why don\'t you actually question the words of the President, who we know, and now you know, lies.\n\nTrump agreed to open the government, with not a single condition. While you must feel angered, you can imagine how people on the other side have felt, for similar reasons- he does not do what he says, and he lies. Now you know this too. You know, what\'s interesting is that people never ""knew"" they couldn\'t trust the news until Trump became President. This was never an issue with 44 other Presidents, including half of which are Republicans. He does not lead from example. How can you tell companies to make their products in the USA, when you make your own products in China? How can you talk about tax reform when you have not paid any taxes yourself, because of various loopholes? These things should have all been red flags. How many times does a Republican President need to tell you that ""trickle down economics"" really works, when every time companies get a tax cut, the issue stock buybacks, making themselves millions, and issuing bonuses to their CEO\'s and shareholders. The Trump tax cuts were no different... This is like an abusive relationship! Your  partner hits you, but you keep going back. Republicans keep feeding you the same ole line, cut taxes for the rich, it will trickle down. ITS A LIE FOLKS. Republicans give themselves tax cuts because it keeps their own up, and keeps us all in our place- down!!\n\nPeople need to start thinking about a political party like a tree, with many branches! Every tree has multiple branches. Political parties have multiple ""branches"", or what are otherwise known as issues. You don\'t go to buy a tree at Lowes and buy it because it has one beautiful flowering branch, and 9 half dead branches. You buy the tree that has 10 healthy branches. This is how political parties are. You might vote Republican because they sell you conservatism, which is a single branch, but if they do all kinds of things to screw you, like lower taxes for the rich, vote to not give you healthcare, etc which are , the other branches, you are buying the wrong tree.\n\nI will conclude with one final point. This IS about Trump. I have been partial to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years. When Bush was in office, I didn\'t like some of the decisions he made, but I never worried about what he was going to do tomorrow. I didn\'t worry about if the government was in chaos in literally every single area, at once. I didn\'t worry about my family and friends, and how taxes and policy changes would affect them. There was not hostility in my family! I didn\'t see people marching with tiki torches through college campuses, or the outward racism or homophobic behavior as I do now. That was the kind of behavior that, if you had it in your head, you kept it to yourself because you knew you were wrong. Now, people think it\'s normal. Had any other Republican candidate won in 2016, I would NOT be wasting my time doing the work I do. I would be on to bigger and better things in life. Yet I am here....trying to make some kind of difference in the world when I would have more success talking to a wall.\n\nSo, if taxes are your thing, and Trump cuts taxes, or your conservative, and Trump talks about conservatism and about how gays are disrupting society and the military, or because you want conservative judges, or whatever your reasoning is in your head- you need to start asking yourself, ""How much in tax cuts, how many gay bans, how many conservative judges are worth MY integrity?""\n\nTrump, ""The Art Of The Deal"", 1987: ""You can\'t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""\n\nI hope today has opened your eyes.']",['en'],2019-01-26,"{'lower_bound': '4000', 'upper_bound': '4999'}",2268558790100197,4999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

Indeed, not just Finland but across the EU and beyond.\n\nI was even more interested because Finland had been subjugated to Russian domination for much of the 20th century, and its increasing participation in the EU was marked by a very cautious approach to both sovereignty and security as it moved to the west. \n\nThe free money approach to social/societal concerns in Finland seemed to me inevitably tilted to the left given its history as a nation.\n\nA recent BBC insight looks at how well the free money experiment has worked.

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"[""Kiwiconnexion members may remember prior to the last NZ election, 2017, a lot of airtime was given to new social experiments such as free money for New Zealanders.  \n\nJohn Campbell hosted a programme that looked at this as well as a host of new initiatives around business, economics, social impacts on housing, tax reforms, etc. It was a strange bit of electioneering that didn't quite come off. \n\nOne of the key topics was about free money, or, a basic universal wage, paid regardless of age, employment status and other indicators: i.e. a universal benefit. At the time, I quite liked it: a bold, innovative initiative, and it implicitly was aimed at greater fairness and equity. Music to a socially aware Methodist?

Was it achievable?\n\nI seem to recall reference  to the Finnish experiment, maybe not in Campbell's programme, but elsewhere in the election campaign.\n\nAt the time, I was particularly interested, because Finland has one of the world's most innovative education systems, and kiwiconnexion users are able to access and deploy the Open Badge Factory credentials system, a major support player in it. Indeed, not just Finland but across the EU and beyond.\n\nI was even more interested because Finland had been subjugated to Russian domination for much of the 20th century, and its increasing participation in the EU was marked by a very cautious approach to both sovereignty and security as it moved to the west. \n\nThe free money approach to social/societal concerns in Finland seemed to me inevitably tilted to the left given its history as a nation.\n\nA recent BBC insight looks at how well the free money experiment has worked.

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"[""Richardson Texas City Council member Scott Dunn took to Twitter recently in defense of President Donald Trump. \n\nWhy Dunn felt Trump, possibly the most prolific and offensive tweeter of all time, could not speak for himself is unclear. \n\nHe wrote:\n\n‚ÄúThe embarrassment is to have bimbos like you with nothing between your ear.‚Äù\n\nFirst, what would one have ‚Äúbetween your ear‚Äù anyway? \n\nI assume he meant 'ears' but it is tough to be proud of a zinger when you make a typo that results in nonsense.\n\nThe subject of his attack? \n\nNew York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \n\nThe formal definition of bimbo, in case anyone was unclear, is ‚Äúan attractive but unintelligent or frivolous young woman.‚Äù \n\nMaybe we should compare resumes?\n\nIn high school, Ocasio-Cortez won second prize in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair with a microbiology research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans. \n\nIN HIGH SCHOOL. \n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude from Boston University in 2011 having majored in international relations and economics. \n\nSome of Boston University‚Äôs famous alumni include the poet Sylvia Plath, television personality and author Bill O‚ÄôReilly, former Senator and Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and civil rights leader Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King. \n\nShe is now a United States Congresswoman.\n\nScott Dunn graduated from Amberton University. \n\nAmberton University is a small school along the side of a busy interstate in Texas where degrees are aimed at the ‚Äúnontraditional student‚Äù. The school offers credits for ‚Äúlife learning‚Äù to undergraduates. \n\nNot surprisingly, the school lists no distinguished alumni. \n\nMaybe Dunn is as good as it gets?\n\nDunn has spent the last 20 years as an account manager in the local Xerox office, basically, a copier salesman. \n\nWhy is it that middle-aged, fat, white men are so threatened by young, attractive, and super-intelligent women? \n\nIs it that some of these women have accomplished more before 30 than these men will in their lifetimes? \n\nDunn has since deleted his Twitter account. \n\nWise choice. \n\nHe was messing with someone WAY out of his league.""]",['en'],2019-02-09,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",296760064322125,1999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

"['The monthly meeting of the Gloucester Democratic City Committee will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14, and will feature a panel discussion focusing on the state of journalism in the ""post-truth"" era.\nPanelists include longtime journalist Jerry Ackerman, activist and filmmaker Laura Wiessen, author and journalist George Rosen and teacher and social media commentator Jeremy McKeen.\nThe rapid demise of subscription-based print media and the rise of digital media have produced many challenges for journalists and consumers/readers alike.  Some of these include coping with the sheer volume of content, knowing what and whom to believe, and choosing how and if to spend money on access to this content.  The simultaneous advances in communications technology have put broadcast media on smartphones, TVs and computers and removed limits on time and place for watching and listening.   Social media has linked networks of friends and organized groups with all of the generators and distributors of news, opinion, and advertising content.  Documentary films have proliferated due to decreasing production costs and a rise in popularity for presenting issues.\nThe panelists will address a number of questions arising out of the changes in the media and information landscape and in the fundamental economics of the news media. Audience participation in the form of written questions for the panelists will be an important part of the forum.\nAbout the panelists\nJerry Ackerman was a practicing journalist for more than 40 years, five of them as an editor with Essex County Newspapers (including the Gloucester Daily Times) and 30 with the Boston Globe. He shared in the Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Globe for coverage of Boston school desegregation, and has received numerous other honors for reporting and writing. In retirement he is a mentor to startup business ventures at MIT and a founding director of the Gloucester Meetinghouse Foundation.\n\nJeremy McKeen is an English teacher, consultant, and a writer and editor for several online magazines and companies. He has been the Social Media Chair for the GDCC for the past year. \n\nChicago-born George Rosen has been a freelance journalist and fiction writer since the late 1960s. He has worked for Democratic officials including Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher and George McGovern. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer teacher in Kenya, where he became the press spokesman for volunteers opposed to the Vietnam War. He has reported on West Africa for the Atlantic, on Mexico for the Boston Globe, and has written op-ed pages of the Boston Globe\'s and  the New York Times. He has been a radio commentator for WBUR and taught writing at Tufts University. A collection of his short stories, The Immanence of God in the Tropics (Leapfrog Press) was published in 2012.\n\nLaura Wiessen has worked as a news and documentary writer, producer and director for more than 15 years, producing programming for such networks as PBS, CNN, The History Channel, MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. She has produced hour-long documentaries on topics ranging from the conditions leading to the impeachment of a President, to the Nazis‚Äô secret killing squads, to the archaeology of the southwestern United States. Laura holds a Master‚Äôs Degree in European History from the University of Chicago.\n\nThe monthly meetings are held at the Gloucester House Restaurant, 63 Rogers St., at 7:30 p.m., preceded by a social hour at 7.']",['en'],2019-02-04,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",2278048215777519,999.0

I previously worked in the City of Springfield‚Äôs CWLP Energy Services Department as an Energy Planner where I scrutinized contracts and proudly saved our city thousands of dollars. So, I've been in the role as a government decision for decades. \n\nMy credentials are Bachelor's Degree from SIU and Master's Degree in Political Science (emphasis in economics) from University of Illinois at Springfield. I'm a precinct committee person and serve on the Sangamon County Zoning Board of Appeals. I was also elected as the Past-Vice President of the Trades and Labor Council; and I am currently the Vice President of the area-wide Illinois Federation of Public Employees (which is under the teachers union). One of my shining moments of public service was being elected as a delegate to the Democrat National Convention. \n\nI‚Äôm here to tell you why I‚Äôd like to earn your respect for this SMEA position:\n\n1.      I'm the only Democrat. There are four people vying for three seats on the SMEA Board, but only on Democrat, so please remember to darken in the oval circle for #JustOne candidate...me. \n\n2.      As a former Energy Planner, I'm no stranger to large financial contracts and can help SMEA make sure they get their best financial bang for their buck. \n\n3.      I'm the kind of guy who ask questions, right? I want to know why and how things work. This characteristic bodes well for the SMEA Board because I will delve into SMEA logistics that effect its location like the multi-mode transportation center that will be built next door to the Bank of Springfield Convention Center.\n\nI'm Andrew Spirio running for the SMEA Board and I ask you to vote for #JustOne to get the best representation.

"[""Arkansas Baptistan Trigger Legislation\n\nOnly a fool writes about abortion. It strikes to the core of so much of our political choices. Many insist that it defined the 2016 election, the one which substantially proved that collectively we are quite addlebrained when the call arises. I'm still confused by the fact that a man who encouraged his paramours to have abortions when he was younger could galvanize the evangelicals to such a degree on this issue. \n\nThis post deals with the idea of using religion as one's sole justification to ban all abortions. It doesn't directly address the idea of abortion as an absolute. It's a distinction that most will ignore. There are legitimate and genuine reasons to wish to abolish most abortion procedures. I'm poking at those sanctimonious legislators who hold up religion as their defense as if such a thing resonates with the spirit of democracy.\n\nI would be a bigger fool to discount all arguments against abortion. I'm not refuting them. I'm refuting the insistence that religion dictates certainty in regards to personal or public policy. Religion as an argument for or against anything can be stretched to fit any issue. Its malleability is what makes it a dangerous tool for political uses. People can easily use it for political purposes, much like Trump has done with several issues. \n\nAnyone watching the arc of current politics can see that Roe V. Wade is going to be abolished - at least for a generation. \n\nAbortion isn't a religious issue.\n\nIt certainly isn't an easy one, either, nor one inviting an easy fix. It's an issue that encapsulates so much human pain, agony, and economics. There's a reason it's both so personal and complicated for both the individual and society. Whether we realize it or not, it's a fair bet we all have family or friends who chose abortion in their lives.\n\nIt isn't a religious issue in the sense you say it is, though.\n\nIf this were true, it would follow that all religious people would wish to ban abortion in Arkansas.\n\nThey don't.\n\nEspecially given the proposed prohibition of cases involving rape, incest, and viability in the recent 'trigger' legislation. It's a strange twist that a gun metaphor defines the bill.\n\nIt's possible to be both a person of faith and in favor of a woman's right to choose, whether we'd choose the same option or not. Let's be clear: cases of rape, incest, and viability are issues outside the scope of secular legislation using religious arguments.\n\nMany of faith would never consider abortion as an option. Unlike their other religious counterparts, they tread with caution when they have the opportunity to insist that their choices be mandated as the only options for other citizens. This is doubly true when instances involving rape, incest or medical issues cloud the circumstances for the person needing options. If those with strong religious convictions wish to serve by example, they'll simply choose to forego abortion services. History has shown that they don't however, and seek abortion services like their non-religious counterparts. Banning abortion will result in only those with resources will be able to get them safely; everyone else will use the inevitable underground system with its inherent risk. \n\nThe ongoing insistence that abortion is within the scope of religious oversight weakens all religious considerations precisely because it falsely asserts that all those of faith will endorse it.\n\nThe hypocrisy of claiming to speak for all those of faith is ridiculous. Many people living here in Baptistan don't abide by the politics of harshness \n\nWatching people of Jason Rapert's caliber preach to the entirety of Arkansas and women, in particular, is the best approximation of tomfoolery that I can conjure. I'll give him a minute, though, because he's undoubtedly planning some new affront to rationality as I write this. He'll have heaven on his side, no doubt. \n\nYou're going to have to get a better argument.\n\nOpposition to abortion rights is one of choice and orientation, not religion. It's convenient for you if you've convinced yourself that it is, as it relieves you or any burden of further thinking on the matter.\n\nIf you insist that religion indeed demands that abortion become illegal, you can't escape the responsibility of telling all others of faith that they are completely wrong or that they don't understand religion.\n\nOther viewpoints don't matter.\n\nOther citizens? Ignored.\n\nConduct unbecoming for a legislator and of anyone of faith.\n\nWe all have friends and family who've had abortions, even if you're unaware of it. There are better options than abortion in most cases - but not all. I can't imagine judging someone's life and heart with sufficient grace to be able to know anything with certainty. All of us can do better, starting with those tasked with making laws which reflect a conflicted democracy.\n\nBless your heart if you disagree.\n.""]",['en'],2019-02-17,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",247587406187188,999.0

I'm a precinct committee person and serve on the Sangamon County Zoning Board of Appeals.

As a former Energy Planner, I'm no stranger to large financial contracts and can help SMEA make sure they get their best financial bang for their buck. \n\n3.      I'm the kind of guy who ask questions, right? I want to know why and how things work.

First, it highlights the desperateness of the left‚Äôs Russia collusion delusion, which is really a cover for its own collusion and subversion of our Constitution and notion of the rule of law.  Second, and even more important, for the first time in my recollection, a prominent public official, our President no less, has boldly called out the left‚Äôs romance with socialism.

"[""The hardest part of running for public office is asking for financial support. Thanks for everyone's kindness at last night's fundraiser. For those who missed it, you may mail a check made out to Friends of Andrew Spiro, 39 Emporia Avenue (62702). Please consider sharing this FB message post with friends as I have included my campaign statement below:\n\nI'm running for Springfield Metropolitan Exposition and Auditorium Authority, also known as SMEA, which decides entertainment and conventions brought into this city for our enjoyment because they need a numbers guy like me.\n\nI currently work in the Illinois Secretary of State Archives Department where I hold elected officials and staff accountable for the historical preservation of documents. I previously worked in the City of Springfield‚Äôs CWLP Energy Services Department as an Energy Planner where I scrutinized contracts and proudly saved our city thousands of dollars. So, I've been in the role as a government decision for decades. \n\nMy credentials are Bachelor's Degree from SIU and Master's Degree in Political Science (emphasis in economics) from University of Illinois at Springfield. I'm a precinct committee person and serve on the Sangamon County Zoning Board of Appeals. I was also elected as the Past-Vice President of the Trades and Labor Council; and I am currently the Vice President of the area-wide Illinois Federation of Public Employees (which is under the teachers union). One of my shining moments of public service was being elected as a delegate to the Democrat National Convention. \n\nI‚Äôm here to tell you why I‚Äôd like to earn your respect for this SMEA position:\n\n1.      I'm the only Democrat. There are four people vying for three seats on the SMEA Board, but only on Democrat, so please remember to darken in the oval circle for #JustOne candidate...me. \n\n2.      As a former Energy Planner, I'm no stranger to large financial contracts and can help SMEA make sure they get their best financial bang for their buck. \n\n3.      I'm the kind of guy who ask questions, right? I want to know why and how things work. This characteristic bodes well for the SMEA Board because I will delve into SMEA logistics that effect its location like the multi-mode transportation center that will be built next door to the Bank of Springfield Convention Center.\n\nI'm Andrew Spirio running for the SMEA Board and I ask you to vote for #JustOne to get the best representation. If you have any questions, please call 217-416-8793 or email AJStunz@gmail.com - thanks!""]",['en'],2019-02-16,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",388320375295625,999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['A Bell Ringer for Economic Teachers - February 25\n\nFeb. 25 is National Chocolate Covered Nut Day. To view the full bell ringer with videos, access it at: http://bit.ly/csenccn\n\nChocolate nuts are considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù goods because demand for them increases as incomes rise. For example, if incomes rise 33% then demand for a chocolate can be expected to rise between 0% and 33%. When it does this, the good is considered ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù For me, an example might be Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups. The more money I have, the more I want to eat them!\n\nOn the other hand, if demand for a good does not increase as income increases, then it is considered an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù good. This means that despite having more money, you want less of the good. For me, an example might be Hershey‚Äôs Kisses. As I feel wealthier, I am less inclined toward Hershey‚Äôs Kisses, and would rather choose something else. Therefore, Hershey‚Äôs Kisses are an inferior good (at least for me).\n\nThere is a third option. There are some things where demand rises faster than income. In other words, at low income levels, there is little demand, but as incomes rise, demand rises faster than income. For instance, imported Belgian pralines (such as Godiva, but there are better brands out there!), are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand. But as income rises, demand suddenly kicks in and grows faster than income. If this happens, the good is considered a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù good.\n\nLet‚Äôs use another example: cars. Inexpensive cars are an inferior good. As people have more money, they want less of them. This a Ford Focus. Cars like Toyota Camrys are normal goods. Demand for them follows increases in income. Lamborghinis, by contrast, are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand, but at a certain income level demand suddenly takes off.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is a normal good?\n2. Why are chocolate covered nuts normal goods?\n3. These same concepts also work in reverse. How does the concept of inferior goods would explain the increase in sales at Walmart when the economy is doing poorly?\n4. Which kinds of chocolates are normal goods for you What about inferior? Luxury?\n\nIf you like bell ringers like this, visit www.certell.org and sign up to receive them in your inbox weekly.']",['en'],2019-02-23,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",360765081317331,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

The more money I have, the more I want to eat them!\n\nOn the other hand, if demand for a good does not increase as income increases, then it is considered an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù good. This means that despite having more money, you want less of the good. For me, an example might be Hershey‚Äôs Kisses. As I feel wealthier, I am less inclined toward Hershey‚Äôs Kisses, and would rather choose something else. Therefore, Hershey‚Äôs Kisses are an inferior good (at least for me).\n\nThere is a third option. There are some things where demand rises faster than income. In other words, at low income levels, there is little demand, but as incomes rise, demand rises faster than income. For instance, imported Belgian pralines (such as Godiva, but there are better brands out there!), are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand. But as income rises, demand suddenly kicks in and grows faster than income. If this happens, the good is considered a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù good.\n\nLet‚Äôs use another example: cars. Inexpensive cars are an inferior good. As people have more money, they want less of them. This a Ford Focus. Cars like Toyota Camrys are normal goods. Demand for them follows increases in income. Lamborghinis, by contrast, are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand, but at a certain income level demand suddenly takes off.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is a normal good?\n2. Why are chocolate covered nuts normal goods?\n3. These same concepts also work in reverse. How does the concept of inferior goods would explain the increase in sales at Walmart when the economy is doing poorly?\n4. Which kinds of chocolates are normal goods for you What about inferior? Luxury?\n\nIf you like bell ringers like this, visit www.certell.org and sign up to receive them in your inbox weekly.']",['en'],2019-02-23,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",360765081317331,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

For example, if incomes rise 33% then demand for a chocolate can be expected to rise between 0% and 33%. When it does this, the good is considered ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù For me, an example might be Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups. The more money I have, the more I want to eat them!\n\nOn the other hand, if demand for a good does not increase as income increases, then it is considered an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù good. This means that despite having more money, you want less of the good. For me, an example might be Hershey‚Äôs Kisses. As I feel wealthier, I am less inclined toward Hershey‚Äôs Kisses, and would rather choose something else. Therefore, Hershey‚Äôs Kisses are an inferior good (at least for me).\n\nThere is a third option. There are some things where demand rises faster than income. In other words, at low income levels, there is little demand, but as incomes rise, demand rises faster than income. For instance, imported Belgian pralines (such as Godiva, but there are better brands out there!), are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand. But as income rises, demand suddenly kicks in and grows faster than income. If this happens, the good is considered a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù good.\n\nLet‚Äôs use another example: cars. Inexpensive cars are an inferior good. As people have more money, they want less of them. This a Ford Focus. Cars like Toyota Camrys are normal goods. Demand for them follows increases in income. Lamborghinis, by contrast, are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand, but at a certain income level demand suddenly takes off.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is a normal good?\n2. Why are chocolate covered nuts normal goods?\n3. These same concepts also work in reverse. How does the concept of inferior goods would explain the increase in sales at Walmart when the economy is doing poorly?\n4. Which kinds of chocolates are normal goods for you What about inferior? Luxury?\n\nIf you like bell ringers like this, visit www.certell.org and sign up to receive them in your inbox weekly.']",['en'],2019-02-23,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",360765081317331,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['A Bell Ringer for Economic Teachers - February 25\n\nFeb. 25 is National Chocolate Covered Nut Day. To view the full bell ringer with videos, access it at: http://bit.ly/csenccn\n\nChocolate nuts are considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù goods because demand for them increases as incomes rise. For example, if incomes rise 33% then demand for a chocolate can be expected to rise between 0% and 33%. When it does this, the good is considered ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù For me, an example might be Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups. The more money I have, the more I want to eat them!\n\nOn the other hand, if demand for a good does not increase as income increases, then it is considered an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù good. This means that despite having more money, you want less of the good. For me, an example might be Hershey‚Äôs Kisses. As I feel wealthier, I am less inclined toward Hershey‚Äôs Kisses, and would rather choose something else. Therefore, Hershey‚Äôs Kisses are an inferior good (at least for me).\n\nThere is a third option. There are some things where demand rises faster than income. In other words, at low income levels, there is little demand, but as incomes rise, demand rises faster than income. For instance, imported Belgian pralines (such as Godiva, but there are better brands out there!), are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand. But as income rises, demand suddenly kicks in and grows faster than income. If this happens, the good is considered a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù good.\n\nLet‚Äôs use another example: cars. Inexpensive cars are an inferior good. As people have more money, they want less of them. This a Ford Focus. Cars like Toyota Camrys are normal goods. Demand for them follows increases in income. Lamborghinis, by contrast, are a luxury good. At low income levels, there is little demand, but at a certain income level demand suddenly takes off.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is a normal good?\n2. Why are chocolate covered nuts normal goods?\n3. These same concepts also work in reverse. How does the concept of inferior goods would explain the increase in sales at Walmart when the economy is doing poorly?\n4. Which kinds of chocolates are normal goods for you What about inferior? Luxury?\n\nIf you like bell ringers like this, visit www.certell.org and sign up to receive them in your inbox weekly.']",['en'],2019-02-23,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",360765081317331,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.  (Adapted from ‚ÄúThe Minimalist Home,‚Äù by Joshua Becker; and ‚ÄúSustainability Starts at Home‚Äù by Dawn Gifford)']",['en'],2019-02-22,"{'lower_bound': '5000', 'upper_bound': '5999'}",155048555396407,5999.0

Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

"['üåéSUSTAINABILITY SUNDAYüåè: ‚ÄúSimplification=Minimalism=Sustainability.  Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

"[""MMT vs. Orthodoxy\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT), often associated with the Green New Deal, is increasingly coming under attack by the old guard--a reactionary group of economist who seemingly are unwilling to passively cede their perch upon a  carefully constructed orthodoxy of economic thought.\n\nMMT began to gain status as a body of thought roughly two and a half decades ago.  MMT  makes several justifiable claims. Among them, a sovereign authority which issues its own currency is not fiscally constrained; or, stated differently,  it can spend on whatever it deems to be a worthy expenditure. Equally important, it need not tax or borrow to fund these purchases; it needs to tax or borrow solely for  inflation control purposes.\n\nThis makes entire sense. If one has the power to create one's own money, then one does not need an external source of funds. This practice occurred during the Nation's early colonial period  and also by both the North and the South during the Civil War.  Problem is,  money creation which outstrips the increase in the Nation's productive capacity  is  inflationary.  This is why taxation and borrowing are necessary; these mechanisms absorb excessive money out of the economy--they are money destruction mechanisms.\n\nMMT is quite clear: monetary expansion achieved through federal spending must be offset by taxation and borrowing in order to prevent inflation within the goods, services, and asset markets. Notably, within circles of the financial elite, there seems to be less concern about inflation within the asset markets. Having stated this, however, spending need not be matched by taxation and borrowing and these money destruction measures need  be employed only to the extent necessary to avoid inflation. Borrowing need not  occur at all, but Treasury Debt Issues  are a convenient tool for interest rate management by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps, more importantly, the current legislative framework, which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to borrow the shortfall  between revenues and expenditures, enables  pro market forces to impose a measure of discipline on Federal government spending due to the public's fear of excessive federal debt.\n\nDespite these clearly laid out principles, the old guard insist on the assertion that MMT principles, if practiced, threaten hyperinflationary conditions. Economist who make these false claims include Larry Summers, the Harvard Economist who, among other prominent roles, was Treasury Secretary during the Clinton years, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics and opinion columnist for the New York Times, and William Bradley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOne would assume these actors know a thing or two about monetary theory so one is left scratching one's head in wonder as to why these economist make claims about hyper inflationary threats posed by MMT theory when MMT economist clearly and consistently explain that monetary expansion can only occur at a pace consistent with supply constraints in order to prevent inflationary build-ups. \n\nThere are possible explanations for their claims. One, they simply have written off MMT as, to use William Dudley's words, ‚Äúcrackpot theory‚Äù, and therefore have not devoted time to the  actual reading of MMT thought. Two, they covet their positions atop the pyramid of orthodox thought and will not willingly concede their respected positions to a bunch of upstart progressive economic thinkers. Or, three, they simply do not trust monetary policy in the hands of the fiscal authorities and therefore knowingly make false claims about Modern Monetary Theory. \n\nAll three of the above theories are quite troubling but the last theory is most troubling because it implies a mistrust of democratic control over the money creation process. It implies a belief among  orthodox economic thinkers  that the powerful tool of money creation is best left to a relatively independent Federal Reserve Board in alliance with the commercial banking sector whose single minded focus on the profit motive is in conflict with the long term human capital investment needed for a healthy nation; and both of which are a step  or two removed from direct democratic control.\n\nThe irony of this position is that it is the same body of economic thought which bought us the Great Financial Crisis and which currently resides over the vast income and wealth disparity which is tearing apart the Country.  It is entirely up to us whether we continue to cede monetary authority to a supply side central banking system guided by elitist notions about what is healthy for the economy, or whether we are to democratically,  through our elected legislative bodies, control the money supply in a manner which ensures full employment, green energy solutions, universal health care and college education needs. It is up to all of us to take note of this very important debate and to not be blinded by an economic orthodoxy which is currently not working for a broad swath of the American people.""]",['en'],2019-03-14,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",641284359642972,999.0

Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity.

Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.

"[""MMT vs. Orthodoxy\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT), often associated with the Green New Deal, is increasingly coming under attack by the old guard--a reactionary group of economist who seemingly are unwilling to passively cede their perch upon a  carefully constructed orthodoxy of economic thought.\n\nMMT began to gain status as a body of thought roughly two and a half decades ago.  MMT  makes several justifiable claims. Among them, a sovereign authority which issues its own currency is not fiscally constrained; or, stated differently,  it can spend on whatever it deems to be a worthy expenditure. Equally important, it need not tax or borrow to fund these purchases; it needs to tax or borrow solely for  inflation control purposes.\n\nThis makes entire sense. If one has the power to create one's own money, then one does not need an external source of funds. This practice occurred during the Nation's early colonial period  and also by both the North and the South during the Civil War.  Problem is,  money creation which outstrips the increase in the Nation's productive capacity  is  inflationary.  This is why taxation and borrowing are necessary; these mechanisms absorb excessive money out of the economy--they are money destruction mechanisms.\n\nMMT is quite clear: monetary expansion achieved through federal spending must be offset by taxation and borrowing in order to prevent inflation within the goods, services, and asset markets. Notably, within circles of the financial elite, there seems to be less concern about inflation within the asset markets. Having stated this, however, spending need not be matched by taxation and borrowing and these money destruction measures need  be employed only to the extent necessary to avoid inflation. Borrowing need not  occur at all, but Treasury Debt Issues  are a convenient tool for interest rate management by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps, more importantly, the current legislative framework, which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to borrow the shortfall  between revenues and expenditures, enables  pro market forces to impose a measure of discipline on Federal government spending due to the public's fear of excessive federal debt.\n\nDespite these clearly laid out principles, the old guard insist on the assertion that MMT principles, if practiced, threaten hyperinflationary conditions. Economist who make these false claims include Larry Summers, the Harvard Economist who, among other prominent roles, was Treasury Secretary during the Clinton years, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics and opinion columnist for the New York Times, and William Bradley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOne would assume these actors know a thing or two about monetary theory so one is left scratching one's head in wonder as to why these economist make claims about hyper inflationary threats posed by MMT theory when MMT economist clearly and consistently explain that monetary expansion can only occur at a pace consistent with supply constraints in order to prevent inflationary build-ups. \n\nThere are possible explanations for their claims. One, they simply have written off MMT as, to use William Dudley's words, ‚Äúcrackpot theory‚Äù, and therefore have not devoted time to the  actual reading of MMT thought. Two, they covet their positions atop the pyramid of orthodox thought and will not willingly concede their respected positions to a bunch of upstart progressive economic thinkers. Or, three, they simply do not trust monetary policy in the hands of the fiscal authorities and therefore knowingly make false claims about Modern Monetary Theory. \n\nAll three of the above theories are quite troubling but the last theory is most troubling because it implies a mistrust of democratic control over the money creation process. It implies a belief among  orthodox economic thinkers  that the powerful tool of money creation is best left to a relatively independent Federal Reserve Board in alliance with the commercial banking sector whose single minded focus on the profit motive is in conflict with the long term human capital investment needed for a healthy nation; and both of which are a step  or two removed from direct democratic control.\n\nThe irony of this position is that it is the same body of economic thought which bought us the Great Financial Crisis and which currently resides over the vast income and wealth disparity which is tearing apart the Country.  It is entirely up to us whether we continue to cede monetary authority to a supply side central banking system guided by elitist notions about what is healthy for the economy, or whether we are to democratically,  through our elected legislative bodies, control the money supply in a manner which ensures full employment, green energy solutions, universal health care and college education needs. It is up to all of us to take note of this very important debate and to not be blinded by an economic orthodoxy which is currently not working for a broad swath of the American people.""]",['en'],2019-03-14,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",641284359642972,999.0

Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.\n\n \n\nThe professor then said, ""OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan"". All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A...... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).\n\n \n\nAfter the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.\n\n \n\nThe second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\n\n \n\nAs the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.\n\n \n\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.\n\n \n\nThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you\'ll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:\n\n \n\n1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n\n \n\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n\n \n\n3.

When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.\n\n \n\nCan you think of a reason for not sharing this?\n\n \n\nNeither could I.']",['en'],2019-03-16,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",1584662831658567,999.0

"[""MMT vs. Orthodoxy\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT), often associated with the Green New Deal, is increasingly coming under attack by the old guard--a reactionary group of economist who seemingly are unwilling to passively cede their perch upon a  carefully constructed orthodoxy of economic thought.\n\nMMT began to gain status as a body of thought roughly two and a half decades ago.  MMT  makes several justifiable claims. Among them, a sovereign authority which issues its own currency is not fiscally constrained; or, stated differently,  it can spend on whatever it deems to be a worthy expenditure. Equally important, it need not tax or borrow to fund these purchases; it needs to tax or borrow solely for  inflation control purposes.\n\nThis makes entire sense. If one has the power to create one's own money, then one does not need an external source of funds. This practice occurred during the Nation's early colonial period  and also by both the North and the South during the Civil War.  Problem is,  money creation which outstrips the increase in the Nation's productive capacity  is  inflationary.  This is why taxation and borrowing are necessary; these mechanisms absorb excessive money out of the economy--they are money destruction mechanisms.\n\nMMT is quite clear: monetary expansion achieved through federal spending must be offset by taxation and borrowing in order to prevent inflation within the goods, services, and asset markets. Notably, within circles of the financial elite, there seems to be less concern about inflation within the asset markets. Having stated this, however, spending need not be matched by taxation and borrowing and these money destruction measures need  be employed only to the extent necessary to avoid inflation. Borrowing need not  occur at all, but Treasury Debt Issues  are a convenient tool for interest rate management by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps, more importantly, the current legislative framework, which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to borrow the shortfall  between revenues and expenditures, enables  pro market forces to impose a measure of discipline on Federal government spending due to the public's fear of excessive federal debt.\n\nDespite these clearly laid out principles, the old guard insist on the assertion that MMT principles, if practiced, threaten hyperinflationary conditions. Economist who make these false claims include Larry Summers, the Harvard Economist who, among other prominent roles, was Treasury Secretary during the Clinton years, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics and opinion columnist for the New York Times, and William Bradley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOne would assume these actors know a thing or two about monetary theory so one is left scratching one's head in wonder as to why these economist make claims about hyper inflationary threats posed by MMT theory when MMT economist clearly and consistently explain that monetary expansion can only occur at a pace consistent with supply constraints in order to prevent inflationary build-ups. \n\nThere are possible explanations for their claims. One, they simply have written off MMT as, to use William Dudley's words, ‚Äúcrackpot theory‚Äù, and therefore have not devoted time to the  actual reading of MMT thought. Two, they covet their positions atop the pyramid of orthodox thought and will not willingly concede their respected positions to a bunch of upstart progressive economic thinkers. Or, three, they simply do not trust monetary policy in the hands of the fiscal authorities and therefore knowingly make false claims about Modern Monetary Theory. \n\nAll three of the above theories are quite troubling but the last theory is most troubling because it implies a mistrust of democratic control over the money creation process. It implies a belief among  orthodox economic thinkers  that the powerful tool of money creation is best left to a relatively independent Federal Reserve Board in alliance with the commercial banking sector whose single minded focus on the profit motive is in conflict with the long term human capital investment needed for a healthy nation; and both of which are a step  or two removed from direct democratic control.\n\nThe irony of this position is that it is the same body of economic thought which bought us the Great Financial Crisis and which currently resides over the vast income and wealth disparity which is tearing apart the Country.  It is entirely up to us whether we continue to cede monetary authority to a supply side central banking system guided by elitist notions about what is healthy for the economy, or whether we are to democratically,  through our elected legislative bodies, control the money supply in a manner which ensures full employment, green energy solutions, universal health care and college education needs. It is up to all of us to take note of this very important debate and to not be blinded by an economic orthodoxy which is currently not working for a broad swath of the American people.""]",['en'],2019-03-14,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",641284359642972,999.0

Have you noticed how ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù our lives are and how much we depend on ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù systems that constantly malfunction and frustrate us, causing stress?  Albert Einstein said, ‚ÄúAny intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex‚Ä¶it takes a touch of genius‚Äîand a lot of courage‚Äîto move in the opposite direction.‚Äù  The ‚Äúaccumulation of stuff‚Äù is fueled by these complex processes that enable our ‚Äúaddiction to consumption.‚Äù  This addiction has led to the distraction of ‚Äúclutter.‚Äù  Simplification is the foundation of minimalism.  To minimalize, let‚Äôs start with our home.  As always, begin with the easiest part of the house and move to the more challenging areas.  The Family or Living Room is where we go to relax, gather with family and friends to share meaningful times and experiences.  We want a space that encourages this.  Remove clutter that is distracting.  Take a picture before you begin ‚Äúdecluttering.‚Äù Look first at the storage areas and examine each item stored there.  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I really need or use this?‚Äù  If not ‚Äúfree-cycle‚Äù it---give it away to someone who needs it or to a charity. Or have a ‚Äúgarage sale.‚Äù  We probably only use 20% of our possessions 80% of the time.  (This is a principle in economics called the ‚ÄúPareto Principle‚Äù that 80% of the effect comes from 20% of the causes.)  Once you have opened up your storage areas, then look at the flat surfaces where we tend to ‚Äústack‚Äù things. (Are you a stacker?) Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I need or use this?  Does it make me feel good?‚Äù If not, consider repurposing it or free-cycling it.  If you do want to keep it, put it in the storage space that you just created.  Finally, look at your walls.  Does what is on the walls truly have meaning or is it just a space filler?  Now, take an ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture.  Your minimalized family room will relax you and let you enjoy family and friends.

"['Teacher Fails Entire Class:  Wise Move  \n\n \n\nThis explains why Socialism won\'t work, and always fails.\n\n \n\nIs this man a genius?\n\n \n\nAn economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had recently failed an entire class. That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.\n\n \n\nThe professor then said, ""OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan"". All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A...... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).\n\n \n\nAfter the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.\n\n \n\nThe second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\n\n \n\nAs the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.\n\n \n\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.\n\n \n\nThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you\'ll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:\n\n \n\n1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n\n \n\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n\n \n\n3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\n\n \n\n4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!  \n\n \n\n5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.\n\n \n\nCan you think of a reason for not sharing this?\n\n \n\nNeither could I.']",['en'],2019-03-16,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",1584662831658567,999.0

"[""MMT vs. Orthodoxy\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT), often associated with the Green New Deal, is increasingly coming under attack by the old guard--a reactionary group of economist who seemingly are unwilling to passively cede their perch upon a  carefully constructed orthodoxy of economic thought.\n\nMMT began to gain status as a body of thought roughly two and a half decades ago.  MMT  makes several justifiable claims. Among them, a sovereign authority which issues its own currency is not fiscally constrained; or, stated differently,  it can spend on whatever it deems to be a worthy expenditure. Equally important, it need not tax or borrow to fund these purchases; it needs to tax or borrow solely for  inflation control purposes.\n\nThis makes entire sense. If one has the power to create one's own money, then one does not need an external source of funds. This practice occurred during the Nation's early colonial period  and also by both the North and the South during the Civil War.  Problem is,  money creation which outstrips the increase in the Nation's productive capacity  is  inflationary.  This is why taxation and borrowing are necessary; these mechanisms absorb excessive money out of the economy--they are money destruction mechanisms.\n\nMMT is quite clear: monetary expansion achieved through federal spending must be offset by taxation and borrowing in order to prevent inflation within the goods, services, and asset markets. Notably, within circles of the financial elite, there seems to be less concern about inflation within the asset markets. Having stated this, however, spending need not be matched by taxation and borrowing and these money destruction measures need  be employed only to the extent necessary to avoid inflation. Borrowing need not  occur at all, but Treasury Debt Issues  are a convenient tool for interest rate management by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps, more importantly, the current legislative framework, which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to borrow the shortfall  between revenues and expenditures, enables  pro market forces to impose a measure of discipline on Federal government spending due to the public's fear of excessive federal debt.\n\nDespite these clearly laid out principles, the old guard insist on the assertion that MMT principles, if practiced, threaten hyperinflationary conditions. Economist who make these false claims include Larry Summers, the Harvard Economist who, among other prominent roles, was Treasury Secretary during the Clinton years, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics and opinion columnist for the New York Times, and William Bradley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOne would assume these actors know a thing or two about monetary theory so one is left scratching one's head in wonder as to why these economist make claims about hyper inflationary threats posed by MMT theory when MMT economist clearly and consistently explain that monetary expansion can only occur at a pace consistent with supply constraints in order to prevent inflationary build-ups. \n\nThere are possible explanations for their claims. One, they simply have written off MMT as, to use William Dudley's words, ‚Äúcrackpot theory‚Äù, and therefore have not devoted time to the  actual reading of MMT thought. Two, they covet their positions atop the pyramid of orthodox thought and will not willingly concede their respected positions to a bunch of upstart progressive economic thinkers. Or, three, they simply do not trust monetary policy in the hands of the fiscal authorities and therefore knowingly make false claims about Modern Monetary Theory. \n\nAll three of the above theories are quite troubling but the last theory is most troubling because it implies a mistrust of democratic control over the money creation process. It implies a belief among  orthodox economic thinkers  that the powerful tool of money creation is best left to a relatively independent Federal Reserve Board in alliance with the commercial banking sector whose single minded focus on the profit motive is in conflict with the long term human capital investment needed for a healthy nation; and both of which are a step  or two removed from direct democratic control.\n\nThe irony of this position is that it is the same body of economic thought which bought us the Great Financial Crisis and which currently resides over the vast income and wealth disparity which is tearing apart the Country.  It is entirely up to us whether we continue to cede monetary authority to a supply side central banking system guided by elitist notions about what is healthy for the economy, or whether we are to democratically,  through our elected legislative bodies, control the money supply in a manner which ensures full employment, green energy solutions, universal health care and college education needs. It is up to all of us to take note of this very important debate and to not be blinded by an economic orthodoxy which is currently not working for a broad swath of the American people.""]",['en'],2019-03-14,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",641284359642972,999.0

"[""MMT vs. Orthodoxy\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT), often associated with the Green New Deal, is increasingly coming under attack by the old guard--a reactionary group of economist who seemingly are unwilling to passively cede their perch upon a  carefully constructed orthodoxy of economic thought.\n\nMMT began to gain status as a body of thought roughly two and a half decades ago.  MMT  makes several justifiable claims. Among them, a sovereign authority which issues its own currency is not fiscally constrained; or, stated differently,  it can spend on whatever it deems to be a worthy expenditure. Equally important, it need not tax or borrow to fund these purchases; it needs to tax or borrow solely for  inflation control purposes.\n\nThis makes entire sense. If one has the power to create one's own money, then one does not need an external source of funds. This practice occurred during the Nation's early colonial period  and also by both the North and the South during the Civil War.  Problem is,  money creation which outstrips the increase in the Nation's productive capacity  is  inflationary.  This is why taxation and borrowing are necessary; these mechanisms absorb excessive money out of the economy--they are money destruction mechanisms.\n\nMMT is quite clear: monetary expansion achieved through federal spending must be offset by taxation and borrowing in order to prevent inflation within the goods, services, and asset markets. Notably, within circles of the financial elite, there seems to be less concern about inflation within the asset markets. Having stated this, however, spending need not be matched by taxation and borrowing and these money destruction measures need  be employed only to the extent necessary to avoid inflation. Borrowing need not  occur at all, but Treasury Debt Issues  are a convenient tool for interest rate management by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps, more importantly, the current legislative framework, which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to borrow the shortfall  between revenues and expenditures, enables  pro market forces to impose a measure of discipline on Federal government spending due to the public's fear of excessive federal debt.\n\nDespite these clearly laid out principles, the old guard insist on the assertion that MMT principles, if practiced, threaten hyperinflationary conditions. Economist who make these false claims include Larry Summers, the Harvard Economist who, among other prominent roles, was Treasury Secretary during the Clinton years, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics and opinion columnist for the New York Times, and William Bradley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOne would assume these actors know a thing or two about monetary theory so one is left scratching one's head in wonder as to why these economist make claims about hyper inflationary threats posed by MMT theory when MMT economist clearly and consistently explain that monetary expansion can only occur at a pace consistent with supply constraints in order to prevent inflationary build-ups. \n\nThere are possible explanations for their claims. One, they simply have written off MMT as, to use William Dudley's words, ‚Äúcrackpot theory‚Äù, and therefore have not devoted time to the  actual reading of MMT thought. Two, they covet their positions atop the pyramid of orthodox thought and will not willingly concede their respected positions to a bunch of upstart progressive economic thinkers. Or, three, they simply do not trust monetary policy in the hands of the fiscal authorities and therefore knowingly make false claims about Modern Monetary Theory. \n\nAll three of the above theories are quite troubling but the last theory is most troubling because it implies a mistrust of democratic control over the money creation process. It implies a belief among  orthodox economic thinkers  that the powerful tool of money creation is best left to a relatively independent Federal Reserve Board in alliance with the commercial banking sector whose single minded focus on the profit motive is in conflict with the long term human capital investment needed for a healthy nation; and both of which are a step  or two removed from direct democratic control.\n\nThe irony of this position is that it is the same body of economic thought which bought us the Great Financial Crisis and which currently resides over the vast income and wealth disparity which is tearing apart the Country.  It is entirely up to us whether we continue to cede monetary authority to a supply side central banking system guided by elitist notions about what is healthy for the economy, or whether we are to democratically,  through our elected legislative bodies, control the money supply in a manner which ensures full employment, green energy solutions, universal health care and college education needs. It is up to all of us to take note of this very important debate and to not be blinded by an economic orthodoxy which is currently not working for a broad swath of the American people.""]",['en'],2019-03-14,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",641284359642972,999.0

"['Teacher Fails Entire Class:  Wise Move  \n\n \n\nThis explains why Socialism won\'t work, and always fails.\n\n \n\nIs this man a genius?\n\n \n\nAn economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had recently failed an entire class. That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer.\n\n \n\nThe professor then said, ""OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan"". All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A...... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).\n\n \n\nAfter the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.\n\n \n\nThe second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\n\n \n\nAs the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.\n\n \n\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.\n\n \n\nThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you\'ll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:\n\n \n\n1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n\n \n\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n\n \n\n3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\n\n \n\n4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!  \n\n \n\n5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.\n\n \n\nCan you think of a reason for not sharing this?\n\n \n\nNeither could I.']",['en'],2019-03-18,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",324124618453157,999.0

And one of the important concepts in economics is scarcity. We all have finite resources, and among them is time. For some people, spending a day in school comes at a high cost. In the movie, Ferris decides to do something about it. The sum of the things he gets to do on his ‚Äúday off‚Äù is the price of going to school. If you could have a day off like Ferris‚Äôs, would you choose it over school?\n\nQuestions:\n1. In your life, think about the costs of some of the other things you do, and what your choices say about what you value. If you are in a lot of activities and clubs, how do you value your free time?\n\n2. How do you spend your summers? What are the opportunity costs of your choices?\n\n3. Do you have friends who don‚Äôt get along? What is the cost of hanging out with one of them over the other?\n\n4.

And one of the important concepts in economics is scarcity. We all have finite resources, and among them is time. For some people, spending a day in school comes at a high cost. In the movie, Ferris decides to do something about it. The sum of the things he gets to do on his ‚Äúday off‚Äù is the price of going to school. If you could have a day off like Ferris‚Äôs, would you choose it over school?\n\nQuestions:\n1. In your life, think about the costs of some of the other things you do, and what your choices say about what you value. If you are in a lot of activities and clubs, how do you value your free time?\n\n2. How do you spend your summers? What are the opportunity costs of your choices?\n\n3. Do you have friends who don‚Äôt get along? What is the cost of hanging out with one of them over the other?\n\n4. If you could goof off for an entire day, how would you spend it?\n\nIf you like critical thinking bell ringers like this, sign up at https://www.certell.org/registration/ to receive them in your inbox each week.

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

(see my published article in ‚ÄúWorld Ecology Report‚Äù 2009 in bio - it‚Äôs dated, but still relevant).\nAlso, according to an article published by Jos√© Manuel S√°nchez Ron: ‚ÄúIt is becoming increasingly clear that chaotic phenomena are abundant in nature. We already see them at work in the fields of economics, aerodynamics, population biology  thermodynamics, chemistry and, of course, in the world of biomedicine. ü¶ãü¶ã\nMy belief is chaos theory can also apply to social media: Social Media for Social Impact.\nI hope that, we too, have the ability to impact not only weather systems, but social structures and injustice by getting our voice, ideas and solutions out in the world. ü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã\nThus, I‚Äôll be posting a lot about the UN‚Äôs agenda to achieve Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 in the coming weeks. ü¶ã\nIf you want to learn about how you too can support their agenda - follow along. ü¶ã\nDress by @reformation and is made from rayon which is basically wood pulp. üì∏by @serenarojasphotography ü¶ã\n#butterflyeffect \n#chaostheory\n#VisionFor2030\n#GlobalGoals\n #SDGs \n#SD5\n#SDGSolutions\n#WomeninMedia']",['en'],2019-03-30,"{'lower_bound': '45000', 'upper_bound': '49999'}",591662194667470,49999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['We have been hearing Dual Credit courses being spoken about at our forums. I love this program because the student has the opportunity to earn college credit while simultaneously earning high school credit. \n\nCourses are offered in many disciplines including economics, English, government, history, math, science, psychology and fine arts. A variety of technical and workforce programs are also available for dual and concurrent enrollment. \n\nThis is an amazing opportunity for our students to assimilate to the rigor of a college course, earn substantial experience, and be better prepared to matriculating into higher education.\n\nI am interested in:\n\n -Retention\n-Success Rates\n-Success rates\n-Matriculation percentage to Collin\n\nCurrently, Collin College does not track this. It is imperative that we accurately gauge the success of this program when meeting college readiness expectations and workforce preparation needs.\nThe Dual Credit concept is a major win for ISDs, parents, students.

"['Immigration Lab: Church Between Borders\n\nThis is an interactive, participatory workshop on immigration from the spiritual tradition of the Christian faith. From families being separated at the border, to the ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù caravan, and refugee admissions at historic lows, immigration is not something any of us can ignore.  This workshop presents a fresh way to talk about immigration, build community, and learn how to extend justice and mercy to our neighbors.\n\nSchedule:\nFriday, April 5, 6:30 - 8:30pm\nSaturday, April 6, 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nThe word immigrant, ger, appears 92 times in the Old Testament and Scripture (Old and New Testaments) repeatedly reminds us of the blessing of the stranger and loving our neighbor, but most Christians report they never talk about immigration in their church. Together we can explore why immigrants are so close to the heart of God and change the conversation #immigrantsareablessingnotaburden.\n\nOpinions tend to run high about the issue of immigration, but often our shared set of facts runs low. If we‚Äôre going to think faithfully about immigration, it‚Äôs important that we share an understanding of how immigration works today and what the Bible has to say about how we think about immigrants.\n\nThis workshop will engage the full self, integrating mind, body and spirit.  Because immigration is a complex and difficult subject that can conjure up strong emotions, Nii Armah Sowah will lead us in collective songs and expressive movement helping make us emotionally and spiritually available to engage in learning and conversation together from a grounded, God-centered space.\n\nWorkshop Facilitators:\nMarissa Aguilera Saints\n\nMarissa is the Denver Regional Immigration Organizer with the CRC Office of Social Justice. In this role, she engages local congregations and pastors in immigration education and advocacy. Marissa also serves as an Elder at All Souls Church of Boulder and as the Alumni co-Chair for the Chinook Fund, a foundation focused on grassroots social justice work in Colorado. Prior to this, Marissa worked internationally. She founded and directed Dsenyo a fair trade company that partnered with women and artisans in Malawi, Zambia and Brazil. As part of Dsenyo, she worked with refugees primarily from Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo (DRC) at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Marissa grew up in Boulder, is an artist and mother of two young boys. She is the daughter of a Cuban immigrant and granddaughter of a Jewish man who fled his homeland (Czechoslovakia) during the Holocaust.\nNii Armah Sowah\n\nNii Armah is a Ghanaian-born Arts Educator, Boulder resident of 20+ years, Community Leader, and Professor of African Dance and Culture at CU Boulder. He is the Founder of the 1000 Voices Project, a community arts organization, which operates on the conviction that whenever we raise our voices collectively, change is inevitable. Nii Armah uses songs, rhythm games, storytelling and dance to facilitate community building, cultivate cross-cultural understanding and encourage personal growth and healing. Drawing from his diverse background, Nii Armah blends his African heritage and understanding of Western culture to provide powerful and unique experiences for participants. His work is based on several years of training as an Expressive Arts Therapist, community builder, and teacher as well as his studies and experiences across the African continent.\n\nNii Armah\'s workshops and classes are grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, meaning, ""I am, because we are."" His pedagogy is steeped in African values like interdependence, mutual reciprocity and the like. The communal setting of his workshops become a laboratory for self-discovery, community building and cross-cultural understanding, recognizing that we don\'t journey alone, but together.\nWorkshop Overview\nSession 1: Immigration Simulation - Stepping into the Shoes of an Immigrant\n\nPart of thinking faithfully about immigration, means that we share an understanding of how immigration works today -- and maybe dispel some myths or misunderstandings that we didn‚Äôt even know we had. In this session we will discover together how a person can legally immigrate today. We often hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt undocumented immigrants just get in line?‚Äù Together we will learn what the lines are, who can get in them (and who can‚Äôt), and how long it can take to get through those lines.\nSession 2: Immigration Storyline - How Did We Get Here?\n\nOne thing that is important for moving forward together is having a common memory about the past. In the United States, as a result of the diversity we enjoy, it can be a challenge to cultivate a common memory about immigration. The purpose of this session is to work toward a shared understanding of immigration history and the values that have shaped our evolving laws. We‚Äôll take into account memories that different groups may have, and together we‚Äôll form a more holistic understanding. We often hear the statement: ‚ÄúMy grandparents came legally, why can\'t others do the same?‚Äù This session will help explore the evolution of immigration policy throughout U.S. history, and reveal how it has prioritized some immigration seekers over others for hundreds of years.\nSession 3: How Do We Think about Immigration as Christians? How Can We Advocate for Change?\n\nAs we listen to the rhetoric and read today‚Äôs headlines about immigration, we can see how our culture defines a person‚Äôs worth based on economics (are they a plus or a minus?) or safety (are they a threat or a benefit?) -- but that is not how Scripture defines the worth of human beings. In this session we‚Äôll consider how Scripture can inform our thinking and our conversation about the issue of immigration. We‚Äôll also consider how we are called to respond -- using our time, talents, treasure, and the power that we have been given as citizens of a democracy. We‚Äôll discuss how our voices and actions can bring about policies that are rooted in faithful thinking and aligned with Scripture‚Äôs call on our lives and our leaders.']",['en'],2019-03-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",580257939154179,1999.0

"['We have been hearing Dual Credit courses being spoken about at our forums. I love this program because the student has the opportunity to earn college credit while simultaneously earning high school credit. \n\nCourses are offered in many disciplines including economics, English, government, history, math, science, psychology and fine arts. A variety of technical and workforce programs are also available for dual and concurrent enrollment. \n\nThis is an amazing opportunity for our students to assimilate to the rigor of a college course, earn substantial experience, and be better prepared to matriculating into higher education.\n\nI am interested in:\n\n -Retention\n-Success Rates\n-Success rates\n-Matriculation percentage to Collin\n\nCurrently, Collin College does not track this. It is imperative that we accurately gauge the success of this program when meeting college readiness expectations and workforce preparation needs.\nThe Dual Credit concept is a major win for ISDs, parents, students.

"['We have been hearing Dual Credit courses being spoken about at our forums.

A variety of technical and workforce programs are also available for dual and concurrent enrollment. \n\nThis is an amazing opportunity for our students to assimilate to the rigor of a college course, earn substantial experience, and be better prepared to matriculating into higher education.\n\nI am interested in:\n\n -Retention\n-Success Rates\n-Success rates\n-Matriculation percentage to Collin\n\nCurrently, Collin College does not track this.

"['We have been hearing Dual Credit courses being spoken about at our forums. I love this program because the student has the opportunity to earn college credit while simultaneously earning high school credit. \n\nCourses are offered in many disciplines including economics, English, government, history, math, science, psychology and fine arts. A variety of technical and workforce programs are also available for dual and concurrent enrollment. \n\nThis is an amazing opportunity for our students to assimilate to the rigor of a college course, earn substantial experience, and be better prepared to matriculating into higher education.\n\nI am interested in:\n\n -Retention\n-Success Rates\n-Success rates\n-Matriculation percentage to Collin\n\nCurrently, Collin College does not track this.

"[""Why did I pick the library board?\n\nLast May I completed my economics degree with Oregon State University.  Juggling school, a full-time job, and a full-time family is one of the hardest things I've ever done.  \n\nDuring that time my contribution to the community was my weekly Wednesday visit to the Family Kitchen to wipe down tables, sweep and mop floors.  I'm still showing up every Wednesday but recently I decided I wanted to increase my community involvement and with school out of the way, I had time to do so.\n\nSitting on a board seemed right up my alley, especially with my experience as an entrepreneur (Sandy Cove Inn) and my local government experience, City of Bend, Oregon Government and currently at Bend Park & Recreation District.\n\nSelecting what board wasn't difficult at all.  I credit my librarian grandpa and Lompoc Public Library's carpet-covered clawfoot reading bathtub for sparking my love of libraries.  As I was growing up, my mom fueled the spark by taking us to the local library on a weekly basis so we could fill up our book buckets and attempt to satisfy our insatiable reading appetites.  \n\nI knew without a doubt that I could get behind and have unlimited energy for a long-term investment in the library.  The love instilled in me for the library has never gone away; in fact, it's only increased.  And now here I am! \n\nMy goal this week is to get 100 people to like or follow my page.  This morning I'm at 72.  Would you help me spread the word about my campaign by sharing this post with your network and inviting them to follow my page?""]",['en'],2019-04-17,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",422600531838053,999.0

I credit my librarian grandpa and Lompoc Public Library's carpet-covered clawfoot reading bathtub for sparking my love of libraries.

The love instilled in me for the library has never gone away; in fact, it's only increased.  And now here I am! \n\nMy goal this week is to get 100 people to like or follow my page.

Additional topics will include the Sierra Club's Ready for 100 program, discussing the impacts of the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line through western Maine, and legislation proposed that will create a Maine 'Green New Deal' with Chloe Maxmin, the bill's sponsor.\n\nLightning round presentations will cover climate impacts and actions throughout Maine including Economics, Energy, Food & Agriculture, Forestry, Health, and Ocean & Riparian systems. These will offer a broad selection of local issues to learn about and participate in. The conference strives for participants to leave the event feeling empowered to implement local solutions to address climate change.\n\nMore on our Keynote Speaker, Gus Speth:\nAn accomplished speaker and environmental advocate, James Gustave Speth served on the faculty of the Vermont Law School as Professor of Law from 2010 to 2015.

"[""Why did I pick the library board?\n\nLast May I completed my economics degree with Oregon State University.  Juggling school, a full-time job, and a full-time family is one of the hardest things I've ever done.  \n\nDuring that time my contribution to the community was my weekly Wednesday visit to the Family Kitchen to wipe down tables, sweep and mop floors.  I'm still showing up every Wednesday but recently I decided I wanted to increase my community involvement and with school out of the way, I had time to do so.\n\nSitting on a board seemed right up my alley, especially with my experience as an entrepreneur (Sandy Cove Inn) and my local government experience, City of Bend, Oregon Government and currently at Bend Park & Recreation District.\n\nSelecting what board wasn't difficult at all.  I credit my librarian grandpa and Lompoc Public Library's carpet-covered clawfoot reading bathtub for sparking my love of libraries.  As I was growing up, my mom fueled the spark by taking us to the local library on a weekly basis so we could fill up our book buckets and attempt to satisfy our insatiable reading appetites.  \n\nI knew without a doubt that I could get behind and have unlimited energy for a long-term investment in the library.  The love instilled in me for the library has never gone away; in fact, it's only increased.  And now here I am! \n\nMy goal this week is to get 100 people to like or follow my page.  This morning I'm at 72.

We\'re now realizing that he lied and exaggerated about his advocating for American Indian Studies and American Indian Students.\n\nPlease read and share this letter from CU Historian and Distinguished Professor, Elizabeth Fenn.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n""In light of this evidence, the conclusion I draw from my research is that during his UND presidency,\nMark Kennedy has not been an advocate for American Indian Studies or American Indian students.\n\n1. Under Kennedy‚Äôs leadership, UND has reduced its American Indian Studies Department\nfrom three TTT lines to one, at the same time making Indian Studies a departmental\n\nsubsidiary of the university‚Äôs History Department.\n2. Also under Kennedy‚Äôs leadership, UND has taken over the building once occupied solely\nby the American Indian Center and American Indian Services, folding these entities into a\nbroadly-based Multicultural Center now housed in the same space. Thus Native students\nno longer have a comfortable, culturally-sensitive place to go on campus.\n\n3. Finally, Kennedy‚Äôs CV overstates his tribal-college collaboration, which appears to have\nbeen nonexistent or nearly nonexistent. Even more egregious‚Äîif I read his CV correctly\n‚ÄîKennedy appears to claim the accomplishments of others as his own.""']",['en'],2019-04-23,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",288580938696029,1999.0

Under Kennedy‚Äôs leadership, UND has reduced its American Indian Studies Department\nfrom three TTT lines to one, at the same time making Indian Studies a departmental\n\nsubsidiary of the university‚Äôs History Department.\n2. Also under Kennedy‚Äôs leadership, UND has taken over the building once occupied solely\nby the American Indian Center and American Indian Services, folding these entities into a\nbroadly-based Multicultural Center now housed in the same space. Thus Native students\nno longer have a comfortable, culturally-sensitive place to go on campus.\n\n3. Finally, Kennedy‚Äôs CV overstates his tribal-college collaboration, which appears to have\nbeen nonexistent or nearly nonexistent.

I credit my librarian grandpa and Lompoc Public Library's carpet-covered clawfoot reading bathtub for sparking my love of libraries.

The love instilled in me for the library has never gone away; in fact, it's only increased.  And now here I am! \n\nMy goal this week is to get 100 people to like or follow my page.

Thus Native students\nno longer have a comfortable, culturally-sensitive place to go on campus.\n\n3.

"[""Why did I pick the library board?\n\nLast May I completed my economics degree with Oregon State University.  Juggling school, a full-time job, and a full-time family is one of the hardest things I've ever done.  \n\nDuring that time my contribution to the community was my weekly Wednesday visit to the Family Kitchen to wipe down tables, sweep and mop floors.  I'm still showing up every Wednesday but recently I decided I wanted to increase my community involvement and with school out of the way, I had time to do so.\n\nSitting on a board seemed right up my alley, especially with my experience as an entrepreneur (Sandy Cove Inn) and my local government experience, City of Bend, Oregon Government and currently at Bend Park & Recreation District.\n\nSelecting what board wasn't difficult at all.  I credit my librarian grandpa and Lompoc Public Library's carpet-covered clawfoot reading bathtub for sparking my love of libraries.  As I was growing up, my mom fueled the spark by taking us to the local library on a weekly basis so we could fill up our book buckets and attempt to satisfy our insatiable reading appetites.  \n\nI knew without a doubt that I could get behind and have unlimited energy for a long-term investment in the library.

"['1 out of 3 adults in Rockland County is on Medicaid?\n\n---\n\nClarkstown - What They Don\'t Want You To Know\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/CTWTDWYTK/posts/?ref=page_internal\n\nRockland County, Medicaid, And The Law Of Unintended ConsequencesÔøΩ\nMedicaid in the United States is a social health care program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a ""government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid?fbclid=IwAR2vIuf_Olkecju4kkLD7kFVOIIzrnn9U2xYKFO9Grd-yE2wYme-FURf7EY\n\nBut look what has happened .... 93% of the population in Kiryas Joel in Orange County is receiving Medicaid and other government services. The ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô situation is not yet that bad in Rockland County but it is climbing as rapidly as the population grows. In Monsey and Spring Valley the percentage of the population receiving Temporary Assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (aka food stamps) and Medicaid is now 61.6% and 52.9% respectively.\n\nThe population of Rockland County is about 320,000 and an astonishing 100,000 are receiving Medicaid in a county which is ranked as one of the top five richest in New York State.\n\nApproximately Twenty-five thousands (25,000) Hasidic children are being ‚Äòeducated‚Äô in private Yeshivas and many of them are receiving no secular education and thus are unfitted for employment in the United States economy. That number is expected to grow in Rockland County to fifty thousands (50,000) within ten years with a corresponding increase in government provided services.\n\nMedicaid needs to be reexamined with reference to the \'Law of Unintended Consequences\' which is often cited but rarely defined.\n\nThis law of economics states that the actions of people - and especially of government - always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended.\n\nEconomists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the famous French economic journalist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the ‚Äúseen‚Äù and the ‚Äúunseen.‚Äù\n\nThe seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy. The unseen were the less obvious, and often unintended, consequences. In his famous essay ‚ÄúWhat Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,‚Äù Bastiat wrote: ""There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen."" Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues, including trade barriers, taxes, and government spending.\n\nhttp://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html?fbclid=IwAR3OBOy_8mim7c4_T5L-jxw2730ZvTr0ANFn5CfRr07wjeve3Y6wYDGw8Cc\n\nIn 2012, researchers from Boise State University made a presentation to the Governor\'s Medicaid Expansion workgroup suggesting that by increasing the number of Medicaid recipients using federal funds Idaho would see an increase overall state employment, reduced costs for small businesses, increased productivity in the labor force, and cost savings in health care expenditures.\n\nThe savings were expected to come from a ""healthier workforce"". More comprehensive research showed that an expansion of insurance coverage actually decreased the labor force and labor productivity.\n\nIn his book ‚ÄòSide Effects‚Äô, University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows why millions of U.S. workers now have an incentive to LIMIT their workweek to 29 hours. Working more each week renders them ineligible for financial assistance, whether that is private insurance or Medicaid coverage.\n\nhttps://www.watchdog.org/national/trump-administration-pushes-forward-on-medicaid-reform/article_b757cf30-6825-11e9-af00-af15aa937548.html\n\nIn places like Kiryas Joel the Law of Unintended Consequences has run to it ultimate limit where a population has maximized its eligibility for a government program by deliberately having a maximized birth rate combined with a population of men who prefer to study the Torah and provided a non-secular education to their children that results in high unemployment in an exploding population.\n\nWho benefits from this unintended consequence and who pays? Perhaps the answer is obvious?\n\nNew York State is the only state that requires Medicaid costs to be passed down to the county where they arise. That is why in Rockland County in times past the Medicaid cost consumed the majority of the property taxes collected by the County Legislature.\n\nWill the situation ever change?\n\nPerhaps that is a question one might ask oneself when considering who to elect to political office.\n\nDuring the upcoming election cycle the issues to be discussed are not Trump, abortion, climate change, or Immigration.\n\nWe need to discuss the following questions:\n\n‚ÄúWhat is to be done about so-called ‚Äòschools‚Äô that refuse to provide a secular education to children?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat is the role of the District Attorney in enforcing the legitimate laws of Rockland County, the state of New York, and the United States?‚Äù\n\n""Why should Medicaid be paid to those whose stated behavior is to procreate and multiply to the maximum degree that is humanely possible thus deliberately creating a situation of their own making of ""limited resources"" that meets the eligibility requirements to receive Medicaid paid for those who have to pay those Medicaid taxes and who limit their own family growth?']",['en'],2019-05-01,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",449056778970356,999.0

"['1 out of 3 adults in Rockland County is on Medicaid?\n\n---\n\nClarkstown - What They Don\'t Want You To Know\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/CTWTDWYTK/posts/?ref=page_internal\n\nRockland County, Medicaid, And The Law Of Unintended ConsequencesÔøΩ\nMedicaid in the United States is a social health care program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a ""government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid?fbclid=IwAR2vIuf_Olkecju4kkLD7kFVOIIzrnn9U2xYKFO9Grd-yE2wYme-FURf7EY\n\nBut look what has happened .... 93% of the population in Kiryas Joel in Orange County is receiving Medicaid and other government services. The ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô situation is not yet that bad in Rockland County but it is climbing as rapidly as the population grows. In Monsey and Spring Valley the percentage of the population receiving Temporary Assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (aka food stamps) and Medicaid is now 61.6% and 52.9% respectively.\n\nThe population of Rockland County is about 320,000 and an astonishing 100,000 are receiving Medicaid in a county which is ranked as one of the top five richest in New York State.\n\nApproximately Twenty-five thousands (25,000) Hasidic children are being ‚Äòeducated‚Äô in private Yeshivas and many of them are receiving no secular education and thus are unfitted for employment in the United States economy. That number is expected to grow in Rockland County to fifty thousands (50,000) within ten years with a corresponding increase in government provided services.\n\nMedicaid needs to be reexamined with reference to the \'Law of Unintended Consequences\' which is often cited but rarely defined.\n\nThis law of economics states that the actions of people - and especially of government - always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended.\n\nEconomists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the famous French economic journalist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the ‚Äúseen‚Äù and the ‚Äúunseen.‚Äù\n\nThe seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy. The unseen were the less obvious, and often unintended, consequences. In his famous essay ‚ÄúWhat Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,‚Äù Bastiat wrote: ""There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen."" Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues, including trade barriers, taxes, and government spending.\n\nhttp://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html?fbclid=IwAR3OBOy_8mim7c4_T5L-jxw2730ZvTr0ANFn5CfRr07wjeve3Y6wYDGw8Cc\n\nIn 2012, researchers from Boise State University made a presentation to the Governor\'s Medicaid Expansion workgroup suggesting that by increasing the number of Medicaid recipients using federal funds Idaho would see an increase overall state employment, reduced costs for small businesses, increased productivity in the labor force, and cost savings in health care expenditures.\n\nThe savings were expected to come from a ""healthier workforce"". More comprehensive research showed that an expansion of insurance coverage actually decreased the labor force and labor productivity.\n\nIn his book ‚ÄòSide Effects‚Äô, University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows why millions of U.S. workers now have an incentive to LIMIT their workweek to 29 hours. Working more each week renders them ineligible for financial assistance, whether that is private insurance or Medicaid coverage.\n\nhttps://www.watchdog.org/national/trump-administration-pushes-forward-on-medicaid-reform/article_b757cf30-6825-11e9-af00-af15aa937548.html\n\nIn places like Kiryas Joel the Law of Unintended Consequences has run to it ultimate limit where a population has maximized its eligibility for a government program by deliberately having a maximized birth rate combined with a population of men who prefer to study the Torah and provided a non-secular education to their children that results in high unemployment in an exploding population.\n\nWho benefits from this unintended consequence and who pays? Perhaps the answer is obvious?\n\nNew York State is the only state that requires Medicaid costs to be passed down to the county where they arise. That is why in Rockland County in times past the Medicaid cost consumed the majority of the property taxes collected by the County Legislature.\n\nWill the situation ever change?\n\nPerhaps that is a question one might ask oneself when considering who to elect to political office.\n\nDuring the upcoming election cycle the issues to be discussed are not Trump, abortion, climate change, or Immigration.\n\nWe need to discuss the following questions:\n\n‚ÄúWhat is to be done about so-called ‚Äòschools‚Äô that refuse to provide a secular education to children?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat is the role of the District Attorney in enforcing the legitimate laws of Rockland County, the state of New York, and the United States?‚Äù\n\n""Why should Medicaid be paid to those whose stated behavior is to procreate and multiply to the maximum degree that is humanely possible thus deliberately creating a situation of their own making of ""limited resources"" that meets the eligibility requirements to receive Medicaid paid for those who have to pay those Medicaid taxes and who limit their own family growth?']",['en'],2019-05-01,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",449056778970356,999.0

"['Dis-Barred: Senate Testimony of Bill Barr\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, Bill Barr, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, and it was a doozy (very official legal term). The following are my thoughts as I watched it. \n\nThe Chairman of the Committee is Lindsey Graham (R-SC). He used his time to discuss the importance of the Mueller Report...actually, just kidding, he did not. He returned to the fresh and exciting subject of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. We hit all our favorite notes: Bleach Bit, personal devices, carelessness. \n\nThis is the worst possible version of Groundhog Day. \n\nHe also said he hadn‚Äôt read the whole report, but is confident that the investigation is over. Had he read the report, he would know that there are still twelve ongoing investigations, but who has the time? (Yes, I‚Äôm being sarcastic)\n\nNext up is Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). It falls to Dianne to summarize the actual nature of the Mueller Report and the reason that Bill Barr has been called before them today. Namely, that he released a highly misleading summary, and then withheld the actual Report for days, all of which ultimately led to Robert Mueller objecting to Barr‚Äôs characterization in writing. Feinstein lays it all out clearly. It‚Äôs a little bit boring if you‚Äôre familiar with it, but it had to be done. \n\nChuck Grassley (R-IA) is the first member to question Barr. He gets right into the important stuff, which is: why did the Clinton campaign pay for the Steele Dossier? Yes, you read that correctly. We are back to Hillary Clinton and the (debunked) notion that the Clinton campaign commissioned that dossier. In fact, it was actually paid for and begun by Marco Rubio‚Äôs PAC, but let‚Äôs not let the facts get in the way here. The Clinton campaign did later take over that information, but it didn‚Äôt originate with them. Grassley is also concerned about ‚Äúspying‚Äù on the Trump campaign and Barr seems content to let him worry. At no point does he correct the record and defend his OWN Department of Justice and explain that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúspy‚Äù on American citizens without following a rigorous legal process in pursuit of an investigation. \n\nPatrick Leahy (D-VT) is up next, and he actually has some questions about the Mueller Report. This is refreshing! Leahy asks the obvious question: why did Barr claim that he did not know how Robert Mueller felt about his Summary, when Mueller had sent him a letter conveying his CLEARLY negative feelings? Barr can‚Äôt really answer this and just rambles for a bit. Leahy asks another killer question: why did Barr claim that the President fully cooperated when we have an entire volume detailing obstruction?  Barr explains that he doesn‚Äôt think those two things are contradictory. ‚ÄúYo, yo, yo, I‚Äômma let you finish, but‚Ä¶‚Äù that makes no sense. Obstruction is not cooperation, by definition. \n\nJohn Coryn (R-TX) takes the stage and he brings the heat...again, against Hillary Clinton. Hillary is in a lot of trouble here, if we are to believe the Republicans. We aren‚Äôt sure why, but we know she is guilty of some things. We just...know it. \n\nI would rather board a shuttle into the sun than summarize Cornyn‚Äôs ramblings, they‚Äôre all debunked conspiracy crap. Donate to MJ Hegar or Joaquin Castro and let‚Äôs remove him. \n\nNext comes Dick Durbin (D-IL), and he is the first one to really start landing punches on Barr. He picks up where Leahy left off, with the patent absurdity of claiming Donald Trump cooperated with the investigation. Durbin asks if McGahn should testify. Barr says they haven‚Äôt waived privilege. INCORRECT, they actually have, and McGahn is now a private citizen anyway. They are really going back and forth, but Durbin is winning the battle. \n\nThen we pause because Mike Lee (R-UT) takes over and it‚Äôs not even worth listening to any of the Republicans at this point. They are all going to talk about The Witch Goody Clinton for the entirety of their time. Barr could get a snack, do a sun salutation, and admire his manicure for a few minutes. They don‚Äôt really have questions, they‚Äôre just filibustering. \n\nSheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) closes out the morning session and calls Barr out for his hairsplitting and blatant bullcrap. Barr says he wasn‚Äôt interested in putting out summaries, even though he released a summary. Whitehouse points this out. Barr gets on the merry-go-round again and says (more or less) it wasn‚Äôt his job to release a summary, so he didn‚Äôt release the Mueller Executive Summaries, he just released a  Barr Summary because he didn‚Äôt want to release a summary. This is all very Red Queen ‚ÄúPainting the Roses Red‚Äù for me, and I think I need some lunch. \n\nJohn Kennedy (R-LA) has a lofty name and absolutely no ability to live up to it. Every time I see him, I feel incredibly encouraged that I, too, could be in the Senate one day. You could as well, my friend! Any one of us would be at least as articulate and perceptive as Senator Kennedy. I don‚Äôt know what he said, it wasn‚Äôt important, he is trying to throw Barr lifelines, but Barr is still struggling to justify his corruption, even with a soft questioner. \n\nYou know who isn‚Äôt a soft questioner? Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). She‚Äôs up next and she proceeds to delicately fillet Barr, serving him his own deceitful conduct with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Klobuchar carefully maneuvered Barr into being Trump‚Äôs defense counsel, thereby demonstrating how unfit he is for his ACTUAL job, which is to be America‚Äôs Attorney General. Donald Trump has a personal counsel AND a White House counsel, but Barr seems to be unaware of the trap and keeps walking into it, trying to defend Trump‚Äôs conduct. An ethical Attorney General wouldn‚Äôt make this mistake. Barr is deeply unethical, and knows that he has to please Donald Trump in order to keep his job. \n\nBen Sasse (R-NE) is up next, and he is quite amped up. I will give Sasse credit for at least attempting to discuss Trump and Russia. It‚Äôs hard to follow him though, because he is speaking so quickly. The entire online world is puzzled and speculating as to whether he is on drugs. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case, but it‚Äôs still odd. \n\nChris Coons (D-DE) takes over questioning. He presses Barr on the fact that the Trump campaign had a bajillion (actual number) contacts with Russia and asks if they should have notified the FBI. Barr tries to find a way to say ‚Äúyes, but it was ok that they didn‚Äôt‚Äù and fails. \n\nJosh Hawley (R-MO) makes his debut and proves that Americans might be too foolish for democracy by acting like a loon. He is Claire McCaskill‚Äôs replacement and he is quite dramatic. He has a lot of feelings about how mean people are to Trump supporters. Unclear what this has to do with anything, but go off, I guess? Get it all out. \n\nFortunately, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) takes over and brings us back from the Daytime Emmy awards and into reality. Blumenthal wants to know if Barr has been discussing these matters with folks in the White House. Barr says no definitively, then hastily backtracks and tries to ‚Äúclarify‚Äù his comments and say that he doesn‚Äôt recall any ‚Äúsubstantive‚Äù content. Rut-roh Shaggy, you know what this means. Stick a pin in that. \n\nJoni Ernst (R-IA) is up next and is talking endlessly about various ways that foreign entities can attack us without bullets, and MSNBC just cuts away because we all realize this is pointless. They discuss what Blumenthal just did to Barr and then head back over when Mazie Hirono steps up. \n\nMazie Hirono (D-HI) is a legend and she scorches Barr with the kind of hot fire that has me up out of my seat. She tells Bill Barr that he is no better than Kellyanne Conway or Rudy Giuliani. That he lied to the American people, he lied to Congress, he is a disgrace, and he should resign. I. AM. HOLLERING.  She presses him on Trump‚Äôs conduct: does he think Trump‚Äôs behavior is acceptable? Barr is clearly upset, and Graham leaps in to save him by shouting about slander. \n\nViolence is always wrong, but let‚Äôs be honest about how many of us would like the chance to smack Lindsey Graham (R-SC). \n\nMarsha Blackburn (R-TN) is up and she is useless. I go to the bathroom. I am reminded that her degree is in Home Economics, no shade intended, only inspiration for those of us that wonder what our homekeeping skills are honing within us. This, ladies: a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. If nothing else, the Republicans constantly remind us what is within reach of the mediocre. \n\nCory Booker (D-NJ) is the next questioner. I have to say, he is uncharacteristically ineffectual here. He is trying to make the point that Barr has sold us a bill of goods and it‚Äôs a terrible thing for the American people, but it never quite lands, at least for me. \n\nIt‚Äôs no problem though, because Kamala Harris (D-CA) is the next to question Bill Barr, and this is must-see TV. Truly. Go watch it. She just works him from start to finish and Barr is literally twisting in his seat looking for help from his staff before it‚Äôs done. \n\nHarris asks him if the President has ever suggested that he open an investigation into anyone. Barr stares, flounders, says he is grappling with the word ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù, Harris helpfully provides a list of synonyms. Barr is flummoxed. Can‚Äôt say yes, can‚Äôt say no, which means YES. He‚Äôs been K.O.ed right out of the gate, but she‚Äôs not done. Harris gets him to admit that he didn‚Äôt look at any of the underlying evidence himself (!), that he made the charging decision and took over responsibility without doing due diligence, and that he didn‚Äôt know if Rod Rosenstein was cleared to work on the case that he was a witness in! The hits are relentless. Harris asks him to recuse, Barr throws Rosenstein (a man who is retiring in a week!) under the bus. It‚Äôs legendary. GO WATCH IT. \n\nThere are few more folks, but nothing else matters. Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) attempt PR mop-up, but the damage is done. We‚Äôve got the headlines, and the questioning in the House tomorrow is sure to be intense. \n\nI can‚Äôt wait. Let‚Äôs air it all out. \n\nWAIT, we‚Äôve got a news alert: Barr WILL NOT testify before the House tomorrow. Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my. Here we go. \n\nOlivia Fletcher\n\nPlease keep your comments civilized. Dissent is welcomed. False information and hate is not.\n\nhttps://thinkwearact.com/pages/comment-policy']",['en'],2019-05-03,"{'lower_bound': '2000', 'upper_bound': '2999'}",371133556843722,2999.0

"['The Con‚Äôs Propaganda Machine, Subtle, Layered and Coming at Us From All Angles\n\nEvery so often, I will watch the amazing Bob Ross paint on the Joy of Painting. I have little talent in regard to painting but he seems to work magic in 30 minutes or less in building an illusion or representation of a reality. I sit there enthralled by the seeming ease, he does it. He begins with layering of color and brings the painting through layers of background and then as it comes into the foreground, it becomes more focused and detailed. But it all works only because of the layered and reinforcing effect of the subtle background. This is exactly the effect of the Con‚Äôs information control and perception warping machine. They, the media make sure that we hear only the most angry and insane of each issue. That we are reminded of only their vision of a consensus at every opportunity that each side of an issue is posed to threaten the pre-conceived and reinforced concepts of the other. It is done on a massive scale, controlled and directed by a central entity and reflects from all souses what they want us to hear and see. \n\nIt is the most powerful propaganda machine in human history because it is done this in a supposedly ‚ÄúFree‚Äù society with a supposedly independent fourth estate. It is so much like a Bob Ross painting. The subtle background and the focused immediate. They use it to protect themselves, and it works, because it comes at us from all angles, all forms of the media. The push for Joe Biden is a perfect example. It‚Äôs everywhere and in different forms. From skewed polls to blatant false attacks on Progressives from coordinated sources, that are then reinforced from political sources. It bounces off, again and again and within the background of the Cons decades‚Äô long assault on historical truth and building that subtle background to make their insanity seem normal. \n\nWhat we see today, only works because the Cons have been able to warp historical truth and create a reality where morals have been morphed into righteous corruption. Even before Fox News, right wing radio was pumping up the volume of hate, ignorance and a world view that only reached friends and family. These are not stupid people, try running a farm and you will quickly understand that it is tough, always changing and required problem solving on a gigantic scale. But what many are, is extremely isolated. Their world is their family, their neighbors and right wing radio. Then include the small businessman and it‚Äôs all about survival. Most businesses fail and if you are not a 50/50 businessman / crook, it‚Äôs likely you won‚Äôt survive. That‚Äôs the Con‚Äôs base and what we have to understand is that the key is economics. If we can support the family farm, create an atmosphere where you don‚Äôt have to be half crook to make it, then we win.

"['1 out of 3 adults in Rockland County is on Medicaid?\n\n---\n\nClarkstown - What They Don\'t Want You To Know\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/CTWTDWYTK/posts/?ref=page_internal\n\nRockland County, Medicaid, And The Law Of Unintended ConsequencesÔøΩ\nMedicaid in the United States is a social health care program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a ""government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid?fbclid=IwAR2vIuf_Olkecju4kkLD7kFVOIIzrnn9U2xYKFO9Grd-yE2wYme-FURf7EY\n\nBut look what has happened .... 93% of the population in Kiryas Joel in Orange County is receiving Medicaid and other government services. The ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô situation is not yet that bad in Rockland County but it is climbing as rapidly as the population grows. In Monsey and Spring Valley the percentage of the population receiving Temporary Assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (aka food stamps) and Medicaid is now 61.6% and 52.9% respectively.\n\nThe population of Rockland County is about 320,000 and an astonishing 100,000 are receiving Medicaid in a county which is ranked as one of the top five richest in New York State.\n\nApproximately Twenty-five thousands (25,000) Hasidic children are being ‚Äòeducated‚Äô in private Yeshivas and many of them are receiving no secular education and thus are unfitted for employment in the United States economy. That number is expected to grow in Rockland County to fifty thousands (50,000) within ten years with a corresponding increase in government provided services.\n\nMedicaid needs to be reexamined with reference to the \'Law of Unintended Consequences\' which is often cited but rarely defined.\n\nThis law of economics states that the actions of people - and especially of government - always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended.\n\nEconomists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the famous French economic journalist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the ‚Äúseen‚Äù and the ‚Äúunseen.‚Äù\n\nThe seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy. The unseen were the less obvious, and often unintended, consequences. In his famous essay ‚ÄúWhat Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,‚Äù Bastiat wrote: ""There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen."" Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues, including trade barriers, taxes, and government spending.\n\nhttp://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html?fbclid=IwAR3OBOy_8mim7c4_T5L-jxw2730ZvTr0ANFn5CfRr07wjeve3Y6wYDGw8Cc\n\nIn 2012, researchers from Boise State University made a presentation to the Governor\'s Medicaid Expansion workgroup suggesting that by increasing the number of Medicaid recipients using federal funds Idaho would see an increase overall state employment, reduced costs for small businesses, increased productivity in the labor force, and cost savings in health care expenditures.\n\nThe savings were expected to come from a ""healthier workforce"". More comprehensive research showed that an expansion of insurance coverage actually decreased the labor force and labor productivity.\n\nIn his book ‚ÄòSide Effects‚Äô, University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows why millions of U.S. workers now have an incentive to LIMIT their workweek to 29 hours. Working more each week renders them ineligible for financial assistance, whether that is private insurance or Medicaid coverage.\n\nhttps://www.watchdog.org/national/trump-administration-pushes-forward-on-medicaid-reform/article_b757cf30-6825-11e9-af00-af15aa937548.html\n\nIn places like Kiryas Joel the Law of Unintended Consequences has run to it ultimate limit where a population has maximized its eligibility for a government program by deliberately having a maximized birth rate combined with a population of men who prefer to study the Torah and provided a non-secular education to their children that results in high unemployment in an exploding population.\n\nWho benefits from this unintended consequence and who pays? Perhaps the answer is obvious?\n\nNew York State is the only state that requires Medicaid costs to be passed down to the county where they arise. That is why in Rockland County in times past the Medicaid cost consumed the majority of the property taxes collected by the County Legislature.\n\nWill the situation ever change?\n\nPerhaps that is a question one might ask oneself when considering who to elect to political office.\n\nDuring the upcoming election cycle the issues to be discussed are not Trump, abortion, climate change, or Immigration.\n\nWe need to discuss the following questions:\n\n‚ÄúWhat is to be done about so-called ‚Äòschools‚Äô that refuse to provide a secular education to children?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat is the role of the District Attorney in enforcing the legitimate laws of Rockland County, the state of New York, and the United States?‚Äù\n\n""Why should Medicaid be paid to those whose stated behavior is to procreate and multiply to the maximum degree that is humanely possible thus deliberately creating a situation of their own making of ""limited resources"" that meets the eligibility requirements to receive Medicaid paid for those who have to pay those Medicaid taxes and who limit their own family growth?']",['en'],2019-05-01,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",449056778970356,999.0

"['Dis-Barred: Senate Testimony of Bill Barr\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, Bill Barr, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, and it was a doozy (very official legal term). The following are my thoughts as I watched it. \n\nThe Chairman of the Committee is Lindsey Graham (R-SC). He used his time to discuss the importance of the Mueller Report...actually, just kidding, he did not. He returned to the fresh and exciting subject of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. We hit all our favorite notes: Bleach Bit, personal devices, carelessness. \n\nThis is the worst possible version of Groundhog Day. \n\nHe also said he hadn‚Äôt read the whole report, but is confident that the investigation is over. Had he read the report, he would know that there are still twelve ongoing investigations, but who has the time? (Yes, I‚Äôm being sarcastic)\n\nNext up is Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). It falls to Dianne to summarize the actual nature of the Mueller Report and the reason that Bill Barr has been called before them today. Namely, that he released a highly misleading summary, and then withheld the actual Report for days, all of which ultimately led to Robert Mueller objecting to Barr‚Äôs characterization in writing. Feinstein lays it all out clearly. It‚Äôs a little bit boring if you‚Äôre familiar with it, but it had to be done. \n\nChuck Grassley (R-IA) is the first member to question Barr. He gets right into the important stuff, which is: why did the Clinton campaign pay for the Steele Dossier? Yes, you read that correctly. We are back to Hillary Clinton and the (debunked) notion that the Clinton campaign commissioned that dossier. In fact, it was actually paid for and begun by Marco Rubio‚Äôs PAC, but let‚Äôs not let the facts get in the way here. The Clinton campaign did later take over that information, but it didn‚Äôt originate with them. Grassley is also concerned about ‚Äúspying‚Äù on the Trump campaign and Barr seems content to let him worry. At no point does he correct the record and defend his OWN Department of Justice and explain that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúspy‚Äù on American citizens without following a rigorous legal process in pursuit of an investigation. \n\nPatrick Leahy (D-VT) is up next, and he actually has some questions about the Mueller Report. This is refreshing! Leahy asks the obvious question: why did Barr claim that he did not know how Robert Mueller felt about his Summary, when Mueller had sent him a letter conveying his CLEARLY negative feelings? Barr can‚Äôt really answer this and just rambles for a bit. Leahy asks another killer question: why did Barr claim that the President fully cooperated when we have an entire volume detailing obstruction?  Barr explains that he doesn‚Äôt think those two things are contradictory. ‚ÄúYo, yo, yo, I‚Äômma let you finish, but‚Ä¶‚Äù that makes no sense. Obstruction is not cooperation, by definition. \n\nJohn Coryn (R-TX) takes the stage and he brings the heat...again, against Hillary Clinton. Hillary is in a lot of trouble here, if we are to believe the Republicans. We aren‚Äôt sure why, but we know she is guilty of some things. We just...know it. \n\nI would rather board a shuttle into the sun than summarize Cornyn‚Äôs ramblings, they‚Äôre all debunked conspiracy crap. Donate to MJ Hegar or Joaquin Castro and let‚Äôs remove him. \n\nNext comes Dick Durbin (D-IL), and he is the first one to really start landing punches on Barr. He picks up where Leahy left off, with the patent absurdity of claiming Donald Trump cooperated with the investigation. Durbin asks if McGahn should testify. Barr says they haven‚Äôt waived privilege. INCORRECT, they actually have, and McGahn is now a private citizen anyway. They are really going back and forth, but Durbin is winning the battle. \n\nThen we pause because Mike Lee (R-UT) takes over and it‚Äôs not even worth listening to any of the Republicans at this point. They are all going to talk about The Witch Goody Clinton for the entirety of their time. Barr could get a snack, do a sun salutation, and admire his manicure for a few minutes. They don‚Äôt really have questions, they‚Äôre just filibustering. \n\nSheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) closes out the morning session and calls Barr out for his hairsplitting and blatant bullcrap. Barr says he wasn‚Äôt interested in putting out summaries, even though he released a summary. Whitehouse points this out. Barr gets on the merry-go-round again and says (more or less) it wasn‚Äôt his job to release a summary, so he didn‚Äôt release the Mueller Executive Summaries, he just released a  Barr Summary because he didn‚Äôt want to release a summary. This is all very Red Queen ‚ÄúPainting the Roses Red‚Äù for me, and I think I need some lunch. \n\nJohn Kennedy (R-LA) has a lofty name and absolutely no ability to live up to it. Every time I see him, I feel incredibly encouraged that I, too, could be in the Senate one day. You could as well, my friend! Any one of us would be at least as articulate and perceptive as Senator Kennedy. I don‚Äôt know what he said, it wasn‚Äôt important, he is trying to throw Barr lifelines, but Barr is still struggling to justify his corruption, even with a soft questioner. \n\nYou know who isn‚Äôt a soft questioner? Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). She‚Äôs up next and she proceeds to delicately fillet Barr, serving him his own deceitful conduct with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Klobuchar carefully maneuvered Barr into being Trump‚Äôs defense counsel, thereby demonstrating how unfit he is for his ACTUAL job, which is to be America‚Äôs Attorney General. Donald Trump has a personal counsel AND a White House counsel, but Barr seems to be unaware of the trap and keeps walking into it, trying to defend Trump‚Äôs conduct. An ethical Attorney General wouldn‚Äôt make this mistake. Barr is deeply unethical, and knows that he has to please Donald Trump in order to keep his job. \n\nBen Sasse (R-NE) is up next, and he is quite amped up. I will give Sasse credit for at least attempting to discuss Trump and Russia. It‚Äôs hard to follow him though, because he is speaking so quickly. The entire online world is puzzled and speculating as to whether he is on drugs. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case, but it‚Äôs still odd. \n\nChris Coons (D-DE) takes over questioning. He presses Barr on the fact that the Trump campaign had a bajillion (actual number) contacts with Russia and asks if they should have notified the FBI. Barr tries to find a way to say ‚Äúyes, but it was ok that they didn‚Äôt‚Äù and fails. \n\nJosh Hawley (R-MO) makes his debut and proves that Americans might be too foolish for democracy by acting like a loon. He is Claire McCaskill‚Äôs replacement and he is quite dramatic. He has a lot of feelings about how mean people are to Trump supporters. Unclear what this has to do with anything, but go off, I guess? Get it all out. \n\nFortunately, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) takes over and brings us back from the Daytime Emmy awards and into reality. Blumenthal wants to know if Barr has been discussing these matters with folks in the White House. Barr says no definitively, then hastily backtracks and tries to ‚Äúclarify‚Äù his comments and say that he doesn‚Äôt recall any ‚Äúsubstantive‚Äù content. Rut-roh Shaggy, you know what this means. Stick a pin in that. \n\nJoni Ernst (R-IA) is up next and is talking endlessly about various ways that foreign entities can attack us without bullets, and MSNBC just cuts away because we all realize this is pointless. They discuss what Blumenthal just did to Barr and then head back over when Mazie Hirono steps up. \n\nMazie Hirono (D-HI) is a legend and she scorches Barr with the kind of hot fire that has me up out of my seat. She tells Bill Barr that he is no better than Kellyanne Conway or Rudy Giuliani. That he lied to the American people, he lied to Congress, he is a disgrace, and he should resign. I. AM. HOLLERING.  She presses him on Trump‚Äôs conduct: does he think Trump‚Äôs behavior is acceptable? Barr is clearly upset, and Graham leaps in to save him by shouting about slander. \n\nViolence is always wrong, but let‚Äôs be honest about how many of us would like the chance to smack Lindsey Graham (R-SC). \n\nMarsha Blackburn (R-TN) is up and she is useless. I go to the bathroom. I am reminded that her degree is in Home Economics, no shade intended, only inspiration for those of us that wonder what our homekeeping skills are honing within us. This, ladies: a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. If nothing else, the Republicans constantly remind us what is within reach of the mediocre. \n\nCory Booker (D-NJ) is the next questioner. I have to say, he is uncharacteristically ineffectual here. He is trying to make the point that Barr has sold us a bill of goods and it‚Äôs a terrible thing for the American people, but it never quite lands, at least for me. \n\nIt‚Äôs no problem though, because Kamala Harris (D-CA) is the next to question Bill Barr, and this is must-see TV. Truly. Go watch it. She just works him from start to finish and Barr is literally twisting in his seat looking for help from his staff before it‚Äôs done. \n\nHarris asks him if the President has ever suggested that he open an investigation into anyone. Barr stares, flounders, says he is grappling with the word ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù, Harris helpfully provides a list of synonyms. Barr is flummoxed. Can‚Äôt say yes, can‚Äôt say no, which means YES. He‚Äôs been K.O.ed right out of the gate, but she‚Äôs not done. Harris gets him to admit that he didn‚Äôt look at any of the underlying evidence himself (!), that he made the charging decision and took over responsibility without doing due diligence, and that he didn‚Äôt know if Rod Rosenstein was cleared to work on the case that he was a witness in! The hits are relentless. Harris asks him to recuse, Barr throws Rosenstein (a man who is retiring in a week!) under the bus. It‚Äôs legendary. GO WATCH IT. \n\nThere are few more folks, but nothing else matters. Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) attempt PR mop-up, but the damage is done. We‚Äôve got the headlines, and the questioning in the House tomorrow is sure to be intense. \n\nI can‚Äôt wait. Let‚Äôs air it all out. \n\nWAIT, we‚Äôve got a news alert: Barr WILL NOT testify before the House tomorrow. Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my. Here we go. \n\nOlivia Fletcher\n\nPlease keep your comments civilized. Dissent is welcomed.

"['1 out of 3 adults in Rockland County is on Medicaid?\n\n---\n\nClarkstown - What They Don\'t Want You To Know\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/CTWTDWYTK/posts/?ref=page_internal\n\nRockland County, Medicaid, And The Law Of Unintended ConsequencesÔøΩ\nMedicaid in the United States is a social health care program for families and individuals with low income and limited resources. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a ""government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid?fbclid=IwAR2vIuf_Olkecju4kkLD7kFVOIIzrnn9U2xYKFO9Grd-yE2wYme-FURf7EY\n\nBut look what has happened .... 93% of the population in Kiryas Joel in Orange County is receiving Medicaid and other government services. The ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô situation is not yet that bad in Rockland County but it is climbing as rapidly as the population grows. In Monsey and Spring Valley the percentage of the population receiving Temporary Assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (aka food stamps) and Medicaid is now 61.6% and 52.9% respectively.\n\nThe population of Rockland County is about 320,000 and an astonishing 100,000 are receiving Medicaid in a county which is ranked as one of the top five richest in New York State.\n\nApproximately Twenty-five thousands (25,000) Hasidic children are being ‚Äòeducated‚Äô in private Yeshivas and many of them are receiving no secular education and thus are unfitted for employment in the United States economy. That number is expected to grow in Rockland County to fifty thousands (50,000) within ten years with a corresponding increase in government provided services.\n\nMedicaid needs to be reexamined with reference to the \'Law of Unintended Consequences\' which is often cited but rarely defined.\n\nThis law of economics states that the actions of people - and especially of government - always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended.\n\nEconomists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the famous French economic journalist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the ‚Äúseen‚Äù and the ‚Äúunseen.‚Äù\n\nThe seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy. The unseen were the less obvious, and often unintended, consequences. In his famous essay ‚ÄúWhat Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,‚Äù Bastiat wrote: ""There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen."" Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues, including trade barriers, taxes, and government spending.\n\nhttp://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html?fbclid=IwAR3OBOy_8mim7c4_T5L-jxw2730ZvTr0ANFn5CfRr07wjeve3Y6wYDGw8Cc\n\nIn 2012, researchers from Boise State University made a presentation to the Governor\'s Medicaid Expansion workgroup suggesting that by increasing the number of Medicaid recipients using federal funds Idaho would see an increase overall state employment, reduced costs for small businesses, increased productivity in the labor force, and cost savings in health care expenditures.\n\nThe savings were expected to come from a ""healthier workforce"". More comprehensive research showed that an expansion of insurance coverage actually decreased the labor force and labor productivity.\n\nIn his book ‚ÄòSide Effects‚Äô, University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows why millions of U.S. workers now have an incentive to LIMIT their workweek to 29 hours. Working more each week renders them ineligible for financial assistance, whether that is private insurance or Medicaid coverage.\n\nhttps://www.watchdog.org/national/trump-administration-pushes-forward-on-medicaid-reform/article_b757cf30-6825-11e9-af00-af15aa937548.html\n\nIn places like Kiryas Joel the Law of Unintended Consequences has run to it ultimate limit where a population has maximized its eligibility for a government program by deliberately having a maximized birth rate combined with a population of men who prefer to study the Torah and provided a non-secular education to their children that results in high unemployment in an exploding population.\n\nWho benefits from this unintended consequence and who pays? Perhaps the answer is obvious?\n\nNew York State is the only state that requires Medicaid costs to be passed down to the county where they arise. That is why in Rockland County in times past the Medicaid cost consumed the majority of the property taxes collected by the County Legislature.\n\nWill the situation ever change?\n\nPerhaps that is a question one might ask oneself when considering who to elect to political office.\n\nDuring the upcoming election cycle the issues to be discussed are not Trump, abortion, climate change, or Immigration.\n\nWe need to discuss the following questions:\n\n‚ÄúWhat is to be done about so-called ‚Äòschools‚Äô that refuse to provide a secular education to children?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat is the role of the District Attorney in enforcing the legitimate laws of Rockland County, the state of New York, and the United States?‚Äù\n\n""Why should Medicaid be paid to those whose stated behavior is to procreate and multiply to the maximum degree that is humanely possible thus deliberately creating a situation of their own making of ""limited resources"" that meets the eligibility requirements to receive Medicaid paid for those who have to pay those Medicaid taxes and who limit their own family growth?']",['en'],2019-05-01,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",449056778970356,999.0

"['‚ÄúI spent the better part of my professional life (1991-2014) working at a libertarian think tank‚Äîthe Cato Institute‚Äîarguing against climate action. As Cato‚Äôs director of Natural Resource Studies (and later, as a senior fellow and eventually vice president), I maintained that, while climate change was real, the impacts would likely prove rather modest and that the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions would greatly exceed the benefits.\n\nI changed my mind about that, however, because (among other things) I changed my mind about risk management.\n\nIf we think about climate risks in the same fashion we think about risks in other contexts, we should most certainly hedge‚Äîand hedge aggressively‚Äîby removing fossil fuels from the economy as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe big debate in climate science right now isn‚Äôt whether or not climate change is occurring‚Äîor whether human activity is the main cause. The big debate is about scale: How much change will there be, over how long a time frame, and how large (or small) will be the follow-on effects.\n\nDespite many decades of research, scientists are still uncertain about how sensitive the atmosphere is to greenhouse gas loading. Evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that a doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere above pre-industrial levels (which we‚Äôre likely to see sometime after mid-century) will eventually warm the planet anywhere between 1.5C and 4.5C (2.7F to 8.1F). That‚Äôs a very large spread.\n\nThe difference between the low-end and high-end estimates is the difference between a passing event of modest consequence and global environmental and economic convulsion the likes of which we‚Äôve never seen.\nThe question, then, is largely about what is the most likely outcome from this wide distribution of possible outcomes. While their arguments might differ at the margins, the so-called ‚Äúlukewarmers‚Äù (of which I counted myself during most of my years at Cato), contend that warming will likely be at the very low-end of the range of likely outcomes, and that it will prove of little consequence to the future beneficiaries of a growing economy.\n\nEnvironmentalists, for their part, argue that warming will almost certainly be at the higher end of the distribution of possible outcomes‚Äìand that, accordingly, we have no time to lose. ‚ÄúThe world is going to end in 12 years,‚Äù claims Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (albeit figuratively), ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt address climate change.‚Äù\nAnd thus, we find ourselves in the midst of a debate about the most likely outcome of climate change, even though the truth is that neither side can know with certainty which variant will come to pass. And, funnily enough, both sides seem to think that the most-likely outcome will dovetail with their preferred political position on other matters. Conservatives insist that environmentalists are greatly exaggerating risks (as is their wont) and that if we follow their climate agenda and abandon fossil fuels, we‚Äôll destroy the global economy and surrender economic liberty (a claim that I once embraced but no longer do, given the remarkable technological advances in low-carbon energy technology). The left argues that conservatives are like the man jumping off the top of a skyscraper, claiming no discernible harm has come to him yet even as he plummets to his doom, and that the solutions are giant programs like the Green New Deal, which entail everything from fossil fuel independence to the entire social agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nHow are we supposed to figure out which side is right?\n\nThe answer is that we can‚Äôt be sure. And that‚Äôs okay. Because in life you rarely know for certain what‚Äôs going to happen next. You plan for a range of outcomes and try to mitigate your exposure to the worst possible risks. There‚Äôs an entire economic discipline on this subject. It‚Äôs called risk management.\n\nRisk management is not about discerning the optimal response to the most likely outcome. It is about discerning the appropriate response to the most likely distribution of possible outcomes. That means incorporating the possibility that climate change, either by a bad roll of the geophysical dice or a large and unexpected societal vulnerability to warming, turns into a bigger problem than we expect.\nIn his most recent book on the economics and policy of climate change, economist Richard Tol outlines three factors that would motivate greater climate ambition if we look beyond the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù outcomes.\n\nThe first is that surprises are weighted toward the bad. Despite some technical ambiguity, scientists believe that the chance of a nasty surprise on the climate front is much larger than the chance of a pleasant surprise. The second is that the risk of locking ourselves into a high-carbon, worse-than-expected climate world is larger than being locked into overly-expensive green energy. That is largely because once CO2 is in the atmosphere‚Äìwhere natural residence times are measured in centuries‚Äîit is very expensive to remove through technical means. Green energy boondoggles, on the other hand, can be reversed rather easily, and will at least deliver some health benefits from reduced air pollution, regardless of how climate change plays out. Lastly, societies have long demonstrated a willingness to pay in order to avoid prompting risks that are asymmetric, ambiguous, and irreversible. Global warming is all three.\n\nWhile Tol‚Äôs arguments might strike some conservatives as a suspicious attempt to smuggle in the ‚Äúprecautionary principle‚Äù (a principle my friend Indur Goklany once railed against in a book I commissioned and edited when I was at Cato), there is an important distinction between accounting for‚Äîand managing‚Äîrisks and uncertainties on the one hand, and applying something akin to the precautionary principle on the other. Conventional risk management treats both sides of the risk equation‚Äîthe chance that outcomes will be either more favorable or less favorable than anticipated‚Äîin an equal fashion. In so doing, it adheres to what economists call the ‚Äúexpected utility‚Äù framework.\n\nThe precautionary principle does not; it puts its policy thumb on bad outcomes. It just so happens that, in the context of climate change, the asymmetry comes down squarely on the side of managing climate risk, with all its ambiguities and potential irreversibilities.\n\nWe make similar decisions about risk in other contexts all the time.\nConsider, for instance, that the most likely outcome of investing your money in equities is a better return than you might receive from investing in other financial instruments, such as municipal bonds.\n\nDoes this mean you should invest all of your money in equities? No. Most investors understand that there is a great deal of uncertainty in markets, and that the returns on investment in any given year are difficult to predict. Investors thus tend to hedge their bets, particularly when economic risks are nondiversifiable (as they are in the climate context).\n\nThink of the distribution of possible outcomes as a deck of cards. Equities have a greater spread of good and bad draws from the deck than do bonds, which pay the same no matter how the wider economy is doing. Investing in bonds is thus an investment in stability; something that is so attractive to investors that they forgo greater returns elsewhere to secure that stability. Investing in cutting CO2 emissions is akin to investing in bonds on the financial front. In fact, if we think of CO2 in the atmosphere as an asset (albeit one with negative returns), then the issue becomes much clearer.\n\nUnfortunately, no analogy is precisely applicable to the climate debate. We have a great deal of historical data, for instance, to inform our sense of the likely distribution of potential outcomes in the finance sector. We have many fewer data points to repair to in the course of informing our sense of the distribution of potential outcomes in the climate arena. We have imperfect geologic records. We have imperfect computer models, which reflect our imperfect understanding of climate dynamics. But that ambiguity is itself a motivating factor for reducing emissions. Never before have we run an experiment where greenhouse gases were loaded into the atmosphere at today‚Äôs rates. We have no backup planet if things go horribly wrong.\n\nWhen asked why I changed my mind about federal climate policy, this is a large part of my answer. \n\nBuilding an argument against climate action upon a forceful claim about the most likely outcome of greenhouse gas emissions is to build an argument upon analytic sand.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to believe with all your heart that the worst-case scenario is sure to happen. You just have to understand that it is one possible outcome. And that we should not be making policy based on an assumption that we are certain of this or that outcome.\n\nWhen it comes to managing large-scale risks, straight-forward economics suggests that we ought to take climate change very seriously.\n\nhttps://thebulwark.com/what-changed-my-mind-about-climate-change/']",['en'],2019-05-22,"{'lower_bound': '0', 'upper_bound': '999'}",890293754636696,999.0

As Cato‚Äôs director of Natural Resource Studies (and later, as a senior fellow and eventually vice president), I maintained that, while climate change was real, the impacts would likely prove rather modest and that the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions would greatly exceed the benefits.\n\nI changed my mind about that, however, because (among other things) I changed my mind about risk management.\n\nIf we think about climate risks in the same fashion we think about risks in other contexts, we should most certainly hedge‚Äîand hedge aggressively‚Äîby removing fossil fuels from the economy as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe big debate in climate science right now isn‚Äôt whether or not climate change is occurring‚Äîor whether human activity is the main cause. \n\nTHE BIG DEBATE IS ABOUT SCALE: How much change will there be, over how long a time frame, and how large (or small) will be the follow-on effects.\n\nDespite many decades of research, scientists are still uncertain about how sensitive the atmosphere is to greenhouse gas loading. Evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that a doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere above pre-industrial levels (which we‚Äôre likely to see sometime after mid-century) will eventually warm the planet anywhere between 1.5C and 4.5C (2.7F to 8.1F). That‚Äôs a very large spread.\n\nThe difference between the low-end and high-end estimates is the difference between a passing event of modest consequence and global environmental and economic convulsion the likes of which we‚Äôve never seen.\nThe question, then, is largely about what is the most likely outcome from this wide distribution of possible outcomes. While their arguments might differ at the margins, the so-called ‚Äúlukewarmers‚Äù (of which I counted myself during most of my years at Cato), contend that warming will likely be at the very low-end of the range of likely outcomes, and that it will prove of little consequence to the future beneficiaries of a growing economy.\n\nEnvironmentalists, for their part, argue that warming will almost certainly be at the higher end of the distribution of possible outcomes‚Äìand that, accordingly, we have no time to lose. ‚ÄúThe world is going to end in 12 years,‚Äù claims Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (albeit figuratively), ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt address climate change.‚Äù\nAnd thus, we find ourselves in the midst of a debate about the most likely outcome of climate change, even though the truth is that neither side can know with certainty which variant will come to pass. And, funnily enough, both sides seem to think that the most-likely outcome will dovetail with their preferred political position on other matters. Conservatives insist that environmentalists are greatly exaggerating risks (as is their wont) and that if we follow their climate agenda and abandon fossil fuels, we‚Äôll destroy the global economy and surrender economic liberty (a claim that I once embraced but no longer do, given the remarkable technological advances in low-carbon energy technology). The left argues that conservatives are like the man jumping off the top of a skyscraper, claiming no discernible harm has come to him yet even as he plummets to his doom, and that the solutions are giant programs like the Green New Deal, which entail everything from fossil fuel independence to the entire social agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nHow are we supposed to figure out which side is right?\n\nThe answer is that we can‚Äôt be sure. And that‚Äôs okay. Because in life you rarely know for certain what‚Äôs going to happen next. You plan for a range of outcomes and try to mitigate your exposure to the worst possible risks. There‚Äôs an entire economic discipline on this subject. It‚Äôs called risk management.\n\nRisk management is not about discerning the optimal response to the most likely outcome. It is about discerning the appropriate response to the most likely distribution of possible outcomes. That means incorporating the possibility that climate change, either by a bad roll of the geophysical dice or a large and unexpected societal vulnerability to warming, turns into a bigger problem than we expect.\nIn his most recent book on the economics and policy of climate change, economist Richard Tol outlines three factors that would motivate greater climate ambition if we look beyond the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù outcomes.\n\nThe first is that surprises are weighted toward the bad. Despite some technical ambiguity, scientists believe that the chance of a nasty surprise on the climate front is much larger than the chance of a pleasant surprise. The second is that the risk of locking ourselves into a high-carbon, worse-than-expected climate world is larger than being locked into overly-expensive green energy. That is largely because once CO2 is in the atmosphere‚Äìwhere natural residence times are measured in centuries‚Äîit is very expensive to remove through technical means. Green energy boondoggles, on the other hand, can be reversed rather easily, and will at least deliver some health benefits from reduced air pollution, regardless of how climate change plays out. Lastly, societies have long demonstrated a willingness to pay in order to avoid prompting risks that are asymmetric, ambiguous, and irreversible. Global warming is all three.\n\nWhile Tol‚Äôs arguments might strike some conservatives as a suspicious attempt to smuggle in the ‚Äúprecautionary principle‚Äù (a principle my friend Indur Goklany once railed against in a book I commissioned and edited when I was at Cato), there is an important distinction between accounting for‚Äîand managing‚Äîrisks and uncertainties on the one hand, and applying something akin to the precautionary principle on the other. Conventional risk management treats both sides of the risk equation‚Äîthe chance that outcomes will be either more favorable or less favorable than anticipated‚Äîin an equal fashion. In so doing, it adheres to what economists call the ‚Äúexpected utility‚Äù framework.\n\nThe precautionary principle does not; it puts its policy thumb on bad outcomes. It just so happens that, in the context of climate change, the asymmetry comes down squarely on the side of managing climate risk, with all its ambiguities and potential irreversibilities.\n\nWe make similar decisions about risk in other contexts all the time.\nConsider, for instance, that the most likely outcome of investing your money in equities is a better return than you might receive from investing in other financial instruments, such as municipal bonds.\n\nDoes this mean you should invest all of your money in equities? No. Most investors understand that there is a great deal of uncertainty in markets, and that the returns on investment in any given year are difficult to predict. Investors thus tend to hedge their bets, particularly when economic risks are nondiversifiable (as they are in the climate context).\n\nThink of the distribution of possible outcomes as a deck of cards. Equities have a greater spread of good and bad draws from the deck than do bonds, which pay the same no matter how the wider economy is doing. Investing in bonds is thus an investment in stability; something that is so attractive to investors that they forgo greater returns elsewhere to secure that stability. Investing in cutting CO2 emissions is akin to investing in bonds on the financial front. In fact, if we think of CO2 in the atmosphere as an asset (albeit one with negative returns), then the issue becomes much clearer.\n\nUnfortunately, no analogy is precisely applicable to the climate debate. We have a great deal of historical data, for instance, to inform our sense of the likely distribution of potential outcomes in the finance sector. We have many fewer data points to repair to in the course of informing our sense of the distribution of potential outcomes in the climate arena. We have imperfect geologic records. We have imperfect computer models, which reflect our imperfect understanding of climate dynamics. But that ambiguity is itself a motivating factor for reducing emissions. Never before have we run an experiment where greenhouse gases were loaded into the atmosphere at today‚Äôs rates. We have no backup planet if things go horribly wrong.\n\nWhen asked why I changed my mind about federal climate policy, this is a large part of my answer. \n\nBuilding an argument against climate action upon a forceful claim about the most likely outcome of greenhouse gas emissions is to build an argument upon analytic sand.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to believe with all your heart that the worst-case scenario is sure to happen. You just have to understand that it is one possible outcome. And that we should not be making policy based on an assumption that we are certain of this or that outcome.\n\nWhen it comes to managing large-scale risks, straight-forward economics suggests that we ought to take climate change very seriously.\n\nhttps://thebulwark.com/what-changed-my-mind-about-climate-change/']",['en'],2019-05-25,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",678503495922057,1999.0

As Cato‚Äôs director of Natural Resource Studies (and later, as a senior fellow and eventually vice president), I maintained that, while climate change was real, the impacts would likely prove rather modest and that the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions would greatly exceed the benefits.\n\nI changed my mind about that, however, because (among other things) I changed my mind about risk management.\n\nIf we think about climate risks in the same fashion we think about risks in other contexts, we should most certainly hedge‚Äîand hedge aggressively‚Äîby removing fossil fuels from the economy as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe big debate in climate science right now isn‚Äôt whether or not climate change is occurring‚Äîor whether human activity is the main cause. \n\nTHE BIG DEBATE IS ABOUT SCALE: How much change will there be, over how long a time frame, and how large (or small) will be the follow-on effects.\n\nDespite many decades of research, scientists are still uncertain about how sensitive the atmosphere is to greenhouse gas loading. Evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that a doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere above pre-industrial levels (which we‚Äôre likely to see sometime after mid-century) will eventually warm the planet anywhere between 1.5C and 4.5C (2.7F to 8.1F). That‚Äôs a very large spread.\n\nThe difference between the low-end and high-end estimates is the difference between a passing event of modest consequence and global environmental and economic convulsion the likes of which we‚Äôve never seen.\nThe question, then, is largely about what is the most likely outcome from this wide distribution of possible outcomes. While their arguments might differ at the margins, the so-called ‚Äúlukewarmers‚Äù (of which I counted myself during most of my years at Cato), contend that warming will likely be at the very low-end of the range of likely outcomes, and that it will prove of little consequence to the future beneficiaries of a growing economy.\n\nEnvironmentalists, for their part, argue that warming will almost certainly be at the higher end of the distribution of possible outcomes‚Äìand that, accordingly, we have no time to lose. ‚ÄúThe world is going to end in 12 years,‚Äù claims Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (albeit figuratively), ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt address climate change.‚Äù\nAnd thus, we find ourselves in the midst of a debate about the most likely outcome of climate change, even though the truth is that neither side can know with certainty which variant will come to pass. And, funnily enough, both sides seem to think that the most-likely outcome will dovetail with their preferred political position on other matters. Conservatives insist that environmentalists are greatly exaggerating risks (as is their wont) and that if we follow their climate agenda and abandon fossil fuels, we‚Äôll destroy the global economy and surrender economic liberty (a claim that I once embraced but no longer do, given the remarkable technological advances in low-carbon energy technology). The left argues that conservatives are like the man jumping off the top of a skyscraper, claiming no discernible harm has come to him yet even as he plummets to his doom, and that the solutions are giant programs like the Green New Deal, which entail everything from fossil fuel independence to the entire social agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nHow are we supposed to figure out which side is right?\n\nThe answer is that we can‚Äôt be sure. And that‚Äôs okay. Because in life you rarely know for certain what‚Äôs going to happen next. You plan for a range of outcomes and try to mitigate your exposure to the worst possible risks. There‚Äôs an entire economic discipline on this subject. It‚Äôs called risk management.\n\nRisk management is not about discerning the optimal response to the most likely outcome. It is about discerning the appropriate response to the most likely distribution of possible outcomes. That means incorporating the possibility that climate change, either by a bad roll of the geophysical dice or a large and unexpected societal vulnerability to warming, turns into a bigger problem than we expect.\nIn his most recent book on the economics and policy of climate change, economist Richard Tol outlines three factors that would motivate greater climate ambition if we look beyond the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù outcomes.\n\nThe first is that surprises are weighted toward the bad. Despite some technical ambiguity, scientists believe that the chance of a nasty surprise on the climate front is much larger than the chance of a pleasant surprise. The second is that the risk of locking ourselves into a high-carbon, worse-than-expected climate world is larger than being locked into overly-expensive green energy. That is largely because once CO2 is in the atmosphere‚Äìwhere natural residence times are measured in centuries‚Äîit is very expensive to remove through technical means. Green energy boondoggles, on the other hand, can be reversed rather easily, and will at least deliver some health benefits from reduced air pollution, regardless of how climate change plays out. Lastly, societies have long demonstrated a willingness to pay in order to avoid prompting risks that are asymmetric, ambiguous, and irreversible. Global warming is all three.\n\nWhile Tol‚Äôs arguments might strike some conservatives as a suspicious attempt to smuggle in the ‚Äúprecautionary principle‚Äù (a principle my friend Indur Goklany once railed against in a book I commissioned and edited when I was at Cato), there is an important distinction between accounting for‚Äîand managing‚Äîrisks and uncertainties on the one hand, and applying something akin to the precautionary principle on the other. Conventional risk management treats both sides of the risk equation‚Äîthe chance that outcomes will be either more favorable or less favorable than anticipated‚Äîin an equal fashion. In so doing, it adheres to what economists call the ‚Äúexpected utility‚Äù framework.\n\nThe precautionary principle does not; it puts its policy thumb on bad outcomes. It just so happens that, in the context of climate change, the asymmetry comes down squarely on the side of managing climate risk, with all its ambiguities and potential irreversibilities.\n\nWe make similar decisions about risk in other contexts all the time.\nConsider, for instance, that the most likely outcome of investing your money in equities is a better return than you might receive from investing in other financial instruments, such as municipal bonds.\n\nDoes this mean you should invest all of your money in equities? No. Most investors understand that there is a great deal of uncertainty in markets, and that the returns on investment in any given year are difficult to predict. Investors thus tend to hedge their bets, particularly when economic risks are nondiversifiable (as they are in the climate context).\n\nThink of the distribution of possible outcomes as a deck of cards. Equities have a greater spread of good and bad draws from the deck than do bonds, which pay the same no matter how the wider economy is doing. Investing in bonds is thus an investment in stability; something that is so attractive to investors that they forgo greater returns elsewhere to secure that stability. Investing in cutting CO2 emissions is akin to investing in bonds on the financial front. In fact, if we think of CO2 in the atmosphere as an asset (albeit one with negative returns), then the issue becomes much clearer.\n\nUnfortunately, no analogy is precisely applicable to the climate debate. We have a great deal of historical data, for instance, to inform our sense of the likely distribution of potential outcomes in the finance sector. We have many fewer data points to repair to in the course of informing our sense of the distribution of potential outcomes in the climate arena. We have imperfect geologic records. We have imperfect computer models, which reflect our imperfect understanding of climate dynamics. But that ambiguity is itself a motivating factor for reducing emissions. Never before have we run an experiment where greenhouse gases were loaded into the atmosphere at today‚Äôs rates. We have no backup planet if things go horribly wrong.\n\nWhen asked why I changed my mind about federal climate policy, this is a large part of my answer. \n\nBuilding an argument against climate action upon a forceful claim about the most likely outcome of greenhouse gas emissions is to build an argument upon analytic sand.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to believe with all your heart that the worst-case scenario is sure to happen. You just have to understand that it is one possible outcome. And that we should not be making policy based on an assumption that we are certain of this or that outcome.\n\nWhen it comes to managing large-scale risks, straight-forward economics suggests that we ought to take climate change very seriously.\n\nhttps://thebulwark.com/what-changed-my-mind-about-climate-change/']",['en'],2019-05-25,"{'lower_bound': '1000', 'upper_bound': '1999'}",678503495922057,1999.0

"['Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: If you find yourself agreeing with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on any matter of economics, you should probably rethink your position, wonder where you went wrong, and withdraw from commenting on such matters until you‚Äôve addressed the root cause of your deficiencies.  In fact, one could probably pass for a fairly capable economist just by forever denouncing every idea from either one of them, and taking the opposite position.  \n\nThis bears mentioning because this past week, the dystopian duo teamed up to propose their latest financial clusterfuss, proving, once again, that two people with half a brain do not equal one smart person.  If anything, just as multiplying a fraction by another fraction actually results in a smaller fraction, so too an idiot squared just produces a dumber idiot. \n\nYet, an alarming number of otherwise sober, level-headed people rushed to praise Team Genius and their ominously named ‚ÄúLoan Shark Prevention Act,‚Äù which is basically just socialism applied to credit cards, converting them all into yet another welfare program.  Under their plan, banks would be prohibited from charging more than 15% interest on credit cards because, after all, banks can borrow money at 2.5% interest from the Federal Reserve, so, they tell us, ‚Äúthere is no justifiable reason that a person -- no matter their background ‚Äì should be charged with an interest rate higher than fifteen percent.‚Äù  And apparently, this just kind of sounds instinctively right to a lot of regular folks across party lines, who know nothing about credit markets or how rates are established, but who do not let that interfere with their new and strongly held belief that this is a reasonable solution to a wanton abuse, and we should all rally behind it. \n\nHey, here‚Äôs an idea: maybe credit scores should have an adversity rating like our new SATs, so people with bad credit can get loans on the basis that their neighborhood was overrun with drugs and their high school had a low graduation rate!\n\nHow Bernie and his ventriloquist dummy arrived at that arbitrary fifteen percent number is anybody‚Äôs guess, but how banks arrive at their rates is anything but arbitrary.  An interest rate is a price; more specifically, it is the price of money.  And people with bad credit have to pay a higher price for money because they represent a greater risk that the money will not be paid back in full, if at all. So banks will either not extend them credit at all, at which point the Left will insist that we force banks to lend to those people anyway, meaning that the cost of the loss the banks will suffer is going to be socialized to the rest of us in the form of higher interest rates to borrow, lower interest rates to save, and/or other bank fees.  \n\nLook, nobody forces anybody to take out a credit card or payday loan.  If you don‚Äôt like the rates, don‚Äôt take the loan, and no, they are not a substitute for actual income.  Please, everybody, stop rigging the economy, and for the love of God, stop turning to the government for everything! ‚ÄúFacebook censored me, credit card rates are too high, silence that person, place taxes on fattening foods so I don‚Äôt eat them, pay off my student loans for the degree I got in a useless pursuit, make my boss pay me more money and give me more time off, because I‚Äôm helpless and everything is someone else‚Äôs fault, now somebody do something!‚Äù \n\nGood heavens what happened?']",['en'],2019-05-27,"{'lower_bound': '7000', 'upper_bound': '7999'}",2335294636748892,7999.0

"['Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: If you find yourself agreeing with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on any matter of economics, you should probably rethink your position, wonder where you went wrong, and withdraw from commenting on such matters until you‚Äôve addressed the root cause of your deficiencies.  In fact, one could probably pass for a fairly capable economist just by forever denouncing every idea from either one of them, and taking the opposite position.  \n\nThis bears mentioning because this past week, the dystopian duo teamed up to propose their latest financial clusterfuss, proving, once again, that two people with half a brain do not equal one smart person.  If anything, just as multiplying a fraction by another fraction actually results in a smaller fraction, so too an idiot squared just produces a dumber idiot. \n\nYet, an alarming number of otherwise sober, level-headed people rushed to praise Team Genius and their ominously named ‚ÄúLoan Shark Prevention Act,‚Äù which is basically just socialism applied to credit cards, converting them all into yet another welfare program.  Under their plan, banks would be prohibited from charging more than 15% interest on credit cards because, after all, banks can borrow money at 2.5% interest from the Federal Reserve, so, they tell us, ‚Äúthere is no justifiable reason that a person -- no matter their background ‚Äì should be charged with an interest rate higher than fifteen percent.‚Äù  And apparently, this just kind of sounds instinctively right to a lot of regular folks across party lines, who know nothing about credit markets or how rates are established, but who do not let that interfere with their new and strongly held belief that this is a reasonable solution to a wanton abuse, and we should all rally behind it. \n\nHey, here‚Äôs an idea: maybe credit scores should have an adversity rating like our new SATs, so people with bad credit can get loans on the basis that their neighborhood was overrun with drugs and their high school had a low graduation rate!\n\nHow Bernie and his ventriloquist dummy arrived at that arbitrary fifteen percent number is anybody‚Äôs guess, but how banks arrive at their rates is anything but arbitrary.  An interest rate is a price; more specifically, it is the price of money.  And people with bad credit have to pay a higher price for money because they represent a greater risk that the money will not be paid back in full, if at all. So banks will either not extend them credit at all, at which point the Left will insist that we force banks to lend to those people anyway, meaning that the cost of the loss the banks will suffer is going to be socialized to the rest of us in the form of higher interest rates to borrow, lower interest rates to save, and/or other bank fees.  \n\nLook, nobody forces anybody to take out a credit card or payday loan.  If you don‚Äôt like the rates, don‚Äôt take the loan, and no, they are not a substitute for actual income.  Please, everybody, stop rigging the economy, and for the love of God, stop turning to the government for everything! ‚ÄúFacebook censored me, credit card rates are too high, silence that person, place taxes on fattening foods so I don‚Äôt eat them, pay off my student loans for the degree I got in a useless pursuit, make my boss pay me more money and give me more time off, because I‚Äôm helpless and everything is someone else‚Äôs fault, now somebody do something!‚Äù \n\nGood heavens what happened?']",['en'],2019-05-27,"{'lower_bound': '7000', 'upper_bound': '7999'}",2335294636748892,7999.0

"['Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: If you find yourself agreeing with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on any matter of economics, you should probably rethink your position, wonder where you went wrong, and withdraw from commenting on such matters until you‚Äôve addressed the root cause of your deficiencies.  In fact, one could probably pass for a fairly capable economist just by forever denouncing every idea from either one of them, and taking the opposite position.  \n\nThis bears mentioning because this past week, the dystopian duo teamed up to propose their latest financial clusterfuss, proving, once again, that two people with half a brain do not equal one smart person.  If anything, just as multiplying a fraction by another fraction actually results in a smaller fraction, so too an idiot squared just produces a dumber idiot. \n\nYet, an alarming number of otherwise sober, level-headed people rushed to praise Team Genius and their ominously named ‚ÄúLoan Shark Prevention Act,‚Äù which is basically just socialism applied to credit cards, converting them all into yet another welfare program.  Under their plan, banks would be prohibited from charging more than 15% interest on credit cards because, after all, banks can borrow money at 2.5% interest from the Federal Reserve, so, they tell us, ‚Äúthere is no justifiable reason that a person -- no matter their background ‚Äì should be charged with an interest rate higher than fifteen percent.‚Äù  And apparently, this just kind of sounds instinctively right to a lot of regular folks across party lines, who know nothing about credit markets or how rates are established, but who do not let that interfere with their new and strongly held belief that this is a reasonable solution to a wanton abuse, and we should all rally behind it. \n\nHey, here‚Äôs an idea: maybe credit scores should have an adversity rating like our new SATs, so people with bad credit can get loans on the basis that their neighborhood was overrun with drugs and their high school had a low graduation rate!\n\nHow Bernie and his ventriloquist dummy arrived at that arbitrary fifteen percent number is anybody‚Äôs guess, but how banks arrive at their rates is anything but arbitrary.  An interest rate is a price; more specifically, it is the price of money.  And people with bad credit have to pay a higher price for money because they represent a greater risk that the money will not be paid back in full, if at all. So banks will either not extend them credit at all, at which point the Left will insist that we force banks to lend to those people anyway, meaning that the cost of the loss the banks will suffer is going to be socialized to the rest of us in the form of higher interest rates to borrow, lower interest rates to save, and/or other bank fees.  \n\nLook, nobody forces anybody to take out a credit card or payday loan.  If you don‚Äôt like the rates, don‚Äôt take the loan, and no, they are not a substitute for actual income.  Please, everybody, stop rigging the economy, and for the love of God, stop turning to the government for everything! ‚ÄúFacebook censored me, credit card rates are too high, silence that person, place taxes on fattening foods so I don‚Äôt eat them, pay off my student loans for the degree I got in a useless pursuit, make my boss pay me more money and give me more time off, because I‚Äôm helpless and everything is someone else‚Äôs fault, now somebody do something!‚Äù \n\nGood heavens what happened?']",['en'],2019-05-27,"{'lower_bound': '7000', 'upper_bound': '7999'}",2335294636748892,7999.0

"['Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: If you find yourself agreeing with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on any matter of economics, you should probably rethink your position, wonder where you went wrong, and withdraw from commenting on such matters until you‚Äôve addressed the root cause of your deficiencies.  In fact, one could probably pass for a fairly capable economist just by forever denouncing every idea from either one of them, and taking the opposite position.  \n\nThis bears mentioning because this past week, the dystopian duo teamed up to propose their latest financial clusterfuss, proving, once again, that two people with half a brain do not equal one smart person.  If anything, just as multiplying a fraction by another fraction actually results in a smaller fraction, so too an idiot squared just produces a dumber idiot. \n\nYet, an alarming number of otherwise sober, level-headed people rushed to praise Team Genius and their ominously named ‚ÄúLoan Shark Prevention Act,‚Äù which is basically just socialism applied to credit cards, converting them all into yet another welfare program.  Under their plan, banks would be prohibited from charging more than 15% interest on credit cards because, after all, banks can borrow money at 2.5% interest from the Federal Reserve, so, they tell us, ‚Äúthere is no justifiable reason that a person -- no matter their background ‚Äì should be charged with an interest rate higher than fifteen percent.‚Äù  And apparently, this just kind of sounds instinctively right to a lot of regular folks across party lines, who know nothing about credit markets or how rates are established, but who do not let that interfere with their new and strongly held belief that this is a reasonable solution to a wanton abuse, and we should all rally behind it. \n\nHey, here‚Äôs an idea: maybe credit scores should have an adversity rating like our new SATs, so people with bad credit can get loans on the basis that their neighborhood was overrun with drugs and their high school had a low graduation rate!\n\nHow Bernie and his ventriloquist dummy arrived at that arbitrary fifteen percent number is anybody‚Äôs guess, but how banks arrive at their rates is anything but arbitrary.  An interest rate is a price; more specifically, it is the price of money.  And people with bad credit have to pay a higher price for money because they represent a greater risk that the money will not be paid back in full, if at all. So banks will either not extend them credit at all, at which point the Left will insist that we force banks to lend to those people anyway, meaning that the cost of the loss the banks will suffer is going to be socialized to the rest of us in the form of higher interest rates to borrow, lower interest rates to save, and/or other bank fees.  \n\nLook, nobody forces anybody to take out a credit card or payday loan.  If you don‚Äôt like the rates, don‚Äôt take the loan, and no, they are not a substitute for actual income.  Please, everybody, stop rigging the economy, and for the love of God, stop turning to the government for everything! ‚ÄúFacebook censored me, credit card rates are too high, silence that person, place taxes on fattening foods so I don‚Äôt eat them, pay off my student loans for the degree I got in a useless pursuit, make my boss pay me more money and give me more time off, because I‚Äôm helpless and everything is someone else‚Äôs fault, now somebody do something!‚Äù \n\nGood heavens what happened?']",['en'],2019-05-27,"{'lower_bound': '7000', 'upper_bound': '7999'}",2335294636748892,7999.0

"['Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: If you find yourself agreeing with Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on any matter of economics, you should probably rethink your position, wonder where you went wrong, and withdraw from commenting on such matters until you‚Äôve addressed the root cause of your deficiencies.  In fact, one could probably pass for a fairly capable economist just by forever denouncing every idea from either one of them, and taking the opposite position.  \n\nThis bears mentioning because this past week, the dystopian duo teamed up to propose their latest financial clusterfuss, proving, once again, that two people with half a brain do not equal one smart person.  If anything, just as multiplying a fraction by another fraction actually results in a smaller fraction, so too an idiot squared just produces a dumber idiot. \n\nYet, an alarming number of otherwise sober, level-headed people rushed to praise Team Genius and their ominously named ‚ÄúLoan Shark Prevention Act,‚Äù which is basically just socialism applied to credit cards, converting them all into yet another welfare program.  Under their plan, banks would be prohibited from charging more than 15% interest on credit cards because, after all, banks can borrow money at 2.5% interest from the Federal Reserve, so, they tell us, ‚Äúthere is no justifiable reason that a person -- no matter their background ‚Äì should be charged with an interest rate higher than fifteen percent.‚Äù  And apparently, this just kind of sounds instinctively right to a lot of regular folks across party lines, who know nothing about credit markets or how rates are established, but who do not let that interfere with their new and strongly held belief that this is a reasonable solution to a wanton abuse, and we should all rally behind it. \n\nHey, here‚Äôs an idea: maybe credit scores should have an adversity rating like our new SATs, so people with bad credit can get loans on the basis that their neighborhood was overrun with drugs and their high school had a low graduation rate!\n\nHow Bernie and his ventriloquist dummy arrived at that arbitrary fifteen percent number is anybody‚Äôs guess, but how banks arrive at their rates is anything but arbitrary.  An interest rate is a price; more specifically, it is the price of money.  And people with bad credit have to pay a higher price for money because they represent a greater risk that the money will not be paid back in full, if at all. So banks will either not extend them credit at all, at which point the Left will insist that we force banks to lend to those people anyway, meaning that the cost of the loss the banks will suffer is going to be socialized to the rest of us in the form of higher interest rates to borrow, lower interest rates to save, and/or other bank fees.  \n\nLook, nobody forces anybody to take out a credit card or payday loan.  If you don‚Äôt like the rates, don‚Äôt take the loan, and no, they are not a substitute for actual income.  Please, everybody, stop rigging the economy, and for the love of God, stop turning to the government for everything! ‚ÄúFacebook censored me, credit card rates are too high, silence that person, place taxes on fattening foods so I don‚Äôt eat them, pay off my student loans for the degree I got in a useless pursuit, make my boss pay me more money and give me more time off, because I‚Äôm helpless and everything is someone else‚Äôs fault, now somebody do something!‚Äù \n\nGood heavens what happened?']",['en'],2019-05-27,"{'lower_bound': '7000', 'upper_bound': '7999'}",2335294636748892,7999.0
